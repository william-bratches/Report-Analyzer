<P>SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	This periodic report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, business strategies, operating
efficiencies or synergies, competitive positions, growth opportunities for existing products, plans and objectives of
management. Statements in this periodic report that are not historical facts are hereby identified as "forward-looking
statements."  Such statements include discussion on the opening of a mill, product uses, completion of EA studies and planned
financing.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Corporate History</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Cardiff Communications, Inc.,  ("the Company") was organized in December 1906 in the State of Utah under
the name Cardiff Mining &amp; Milling Company.  During the 60's the Company changed its name to Cardiff Industries,
Inc. and sold its mining operations.  During the next decade the Company focused its operations on the television
and radio industry.  Consequently in 1980, the Company's name was changed to Cardiff Communications, Inc.. The
Company changed it's domicile to the state of Nevada which was effective in 1999 and filed with the Secretary of
State Nevada in 2001.  The Company has had no operations in the last 10 years, but intends to pursue business
opportunities in the communications industry.</P>

<P>					</P>

<P>	The board of directors feel that the Company does not meet the criteria of a development stage company (as
defined in SFAS 7 "<EM>Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises</EM>") primarily because it is not
currently producing or marketing a product or service. However, in September  2004,the Company executed an
agreement to acquire all of the equity of Summit Media, Inc. ("Summit"), a privately-held Utah corporation.  The
agreement closed on March 21, 2005.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>          Upon closing of the acquisition, Summit  became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  Pursuant to
the transaction, the shareholders of Summit were issued a convertible note in the amount of $30,000.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	This transaction resulted in a change of control of management.  Following notice and filing pursuant to Rule
14f-1, the sole officer and director resigned on May 23, 2005.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Summit Media was formed in March of 2004 to acquire and develop television broadcast licenses. Summit
has already acquired a low power television ("LPTV") station construction permit ("CP") W28BO "Channel 28",
which is currently licensed to the city of Acton, Tennessee.  The Purchase Agreement provides for payments to the
sellers upon the occurrence of certain events in the FCC compliance process.  The Company's goal is to create value
to the station prior to the build out of the station.<STRIKE></STRIKE></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The license authorizes up to 1.0 KW broadcast power and is authorized to broadcast 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week.  Acton is a growing bedroom community in Tennessee. Because of this, the Company believes that, as a
currently non-broadcasting license, the license purchase price is commercially reasonable. The Company also
believes that with proper program development, the "value" of the station can be greatly enhanced. </P>

<P>  </P>

<P>	The Company intends to negotiate a lease to install antennae and transmitter equipment on a television
broadcast tower facility located in Acton. The broadcast signal, referred to in the industry as the "footprint," will
reach most of the surrounding populated area. Through FCC imposed limitations, most LPTV licenses are limited
in the amount of broadcast power; including W28BO which is limited to 1.0 KW in broadcast power.</P>

outstanding, consented to the an increase in the number of authorized common shares from 10,000,000 to

<STRONG>ITEM 5.  MARKET PRICE FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND  RELATED
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS</STRONG>

<P>							</P>

<P>	The Company's common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD") under the symbol "CDFO.OB".   As of December 13, 2005, the Company had
approximately 1,259 shareholders of record.  The Company has been unable to obtain any historical information.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The Company has not declared any cash dividends on its Common Stock in the last thirty years and its Board
of Directors has no present intention of declaring any dividends.  For the foreseeable future, the Company intends
to retain all earnings, if any, for use in the development and expansion of its business.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The Company shares are subject to section 15(g) and rule 15g-9 of the Securities and Exchange Act,
commonly referred to as the "penny stock" rule.  The rule defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a
market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The rule provides that any equity security is
considered to be a penny stock unless that security is; registered and traded on a national securities exchange
meeting specified criteria set by the SEC; authorized for quotation from the NASDAQ stock market; issued by a
registered investment company; excluded from the definition on the basis of price at least $5.00 per share or the
issuer's net tangible assets.  The Company's shares are deemed to be penny stock, trading in the shares will be
subject to additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than
established customers and accredited investors.  Accredited investors, in general, include individuals with assets
in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse, and certain
institutional investors.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	For transactions covered by these rules, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the
purchase of such security and must have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the
purchase.  Additionally, for the transaction involving a penny stock, other rules apply.  Consequently, these rules
may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to trade or maintain a market in our common stock and may affect the
ability of shareholders to sell their shares.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"></FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The Board of Directors deemed in it the Company's best interest and the shareholders holding a majority
of the Company's outstanding common stock consented to a reverse split of the Company's common stock on a
basis of up to 100 to 1. The reverse became effective September 15, 2005. The recapitalization reduced on a 100
to 1 basis the issued and outstanding shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share through a
reverse split or consolidation, so that shareholders will receive one (1) share of Common Stock for every one
hundred (100) shares of Common Stock now held by the shareholder.  In an effort to preserve shareholders in "round
lots", which is of benefit to the shareholders and the Company, no certificate below one hundred shares was reversed
and no certificate greater than one hundred shares was reversed below one hundred shares.  No fractional shares
were issued in connection with such recapitalization and only fractional shares were rounded up to the nearest whole
number.  This transaction is not intended to be a "going private" transaction.  The rights of existing shareholders
will not be altered and no shareholder will be eliminated as a result of the reverse split. </P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	In September, the Company accepted the conversion of  $30,000 owed to the Company's current officer and
director of debt for the issuance of 10,000,000  post-split shares of the Company's common stock. Common Stock
and Additional paid in capital were credited for the appropriate amounts.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	As a result of the above new issuances and the reverse split of common stock the Company's outstanding
shares of common stock was increased from 9,990,544 (pre-split) at the beginning of 2004 to 10,239,499 (post-split)
at December 13, 2005. </P>

<P><STRONG>	AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>Financial Condition</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The Company had no revenue during the year ended September 30, 2005.  The total accumulated deficit for
the year ended September 30, 2005 was  $188,500, as compared $127,253 at September 30, 2004. The Company
has no operating capital for future operations.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>Liquidity and Capital Resources</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The Company has  minimal liquid assets and is currently in the process of looking for business opportunities
to merge with or acquire.  At minimum, the Company will need to raise additional capital through private funding
to meet the financial needs of being a reporting company.  Historically, the Company has been successful in raising
operational capital.  There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in obtaining necessary funding to
develop any business opportunities.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>Results of Operations</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The Company reported a net loss of $61,247 for the year ended September 30, 2005, compared to a net loss
of $76,939 for the previous year.  The Company anticipates very little or no overhead from future operations except
for those expenses related to being a reporting company, until a successor business can be acquired or merged.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	During September 2005, approximately $6,500 of accounts payable were settled in exchange for a
convertible note and are reflected in that portion of the Company's financial statements.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Cardiff Communications, Inc., as
of September 30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended.  These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the company's management.  Our responsibility is to express and
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board, (United States of America).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Cardiff Communications, Inc., at September 30, 2005 and 2004,
and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity withU.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will
continue as a going concern.  As discussed in Note 5, the Company's recurring operating losses and
lack of working capital raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Management's plans in regard to those matters are also described in Note 5.  The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>NOTE 1 - Corporate History</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Company was organized on December 8, 1906 in the State of Utah under the name of "Cardiff
Industries."  Subsequently, the name was changed to "Cardiff Communications, Inc.".   During 2001,
the Company changed its domicile to the State of Nevada. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On March 22, 2005, the Company entered into an acquisition agreement with Summit Media, Inc.
("Summit"), a privately-held Utah corporation.  Pursuant to the agreement, the Company exchanged
a $30,000 convertible note for all of the outstanding common stock of Summit.  In September 2005,
the convertible note was converted into 10,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>NOTE 2 - Significant Accounting Policies</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>A.	The Company uses the accrual method of accounting.</P>

<P>B.	Revenues and directly related expenses are recognized in the period when the goods are
shipped to the customer. </P>

<P>C.	The Company considers all short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible,
within three months, to known amounts as cash equivalents.  The Company currently has no
cash equivalents. </P>

<P>D.	Basic Earnings Per Shares are computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period.  Diluted Earnings Per Share shall be computed by including contingently issuable
shares with the weighted average shares outstanding during the period.  When inclusion of
the contingently issuable shares would have an antidilutive effect upon earnings per share
no diluted earnings per share shall be presented.</P>

<P>E.	Estimates:   The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results
could differ from those estimates.</P>

<P>F.	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.  In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized.
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives.  All intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis.
During the years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized an
impairment loss on goodwill of $41,653 and $0, respectively.</P>

<P>G.	Basis of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements for the year ended September
30, 2005 include the accounts of Summit Media, Inc.  All significant inter-company accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation.</P>

<P>H. 	Financial Instruments. The recorded amounts of financial instruments, including cash
equivalents, accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable approximate their market
values as of September 30, 2005 and 2004. The Company has no investments in derivative
financial instruments.</P>

<P><STRONG>NOTE 3 - Income Taxes</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Company adopted Statement of Financial Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income taxes" in
the fiscal year ended September 30, 1999.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" requires an
asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income tax purposes.  This
statement recognizes (a) the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (b)
deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized
in the financial statements or tax returns.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of accounting
transactions for tax and financial reporting purposes.  There were no temporary differences for the
current year accordingly, no deferred tax liabilities have been recognized.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Company has cumulative net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $188,500 at
September 30, 2005.  No effect has been shown in the financial statements for the net operating loss
carryforwards as the likelihood of future tax benefit from such net operating loss carryforwards is
highly improbable.  Accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net operating loss carryforwards,
estimated based upon current tax rates at September 30, 2005 have been offset by valuation reserves
of the same amount.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles
applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of
liabilities in the normal course of business.  Currently, the Company does not have significant cash
or other material assets, nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its
operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern.  The Company does not currently
possess a financial institution source of financing and the Company cannot be certain that it's
existing sources of cash will be adequate to meet its liquidity requirements.  However, the Company
is undertaking the following approach to meet its liquidity requirements.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	(a)	Seek additional equity funding through private placements to raise sufficient funds to
continue operations and fund its ongoing development, merger and acquisition activities. </P>

<P>	(b)	The Company will seek to continue converting certain outstanding loans and payables
into common stock in order to reduce future cash obligations;</P>

<P>	(c)	Management is identifying prospective acquisition targets with sufficient cash flow to
fund operations, as well as potentially generating operating cash flow that may sustain
corporate administrative expenses; <BR>
</P>

<P>The Company's future capital requirements will depend on its ability to successfully implement these
initiatives.</P>
