                              Item 1.  Business.

Overview

A Massachusetts corporation formed in 1968, we are a designer and supplier of
data storage products and solutions. Our products include memory for computing
systems and fibre channel connectivity and storage products used to build
storage area networks (SANs).

We design, manufacture, and market memory products that enhance the
performance and reliability of computing systems and networking devices.  We
have been selling memory products to our customers since 1970.  A processor's
memory is used to hold temporary instructions and data needed to execute
tasks.  This enables the computer's CPU to access instructions and data
quickly.  After upgrading a processor's memory, the computer will process data
faster, because it will need to access its slower secondary storage (i.e., the
disk drive) less frequently.  We provide memory upgrade solutions for all of
the major servers and workstations manufactured by IBM, Sun and Hewlett-
Packard.  Adding additional memory is both application transparent and the
most cost-effective solution for eliminating many system performance
bottlenecks.

We began developing our current fibre channel SAN product business in 1997.
SANs enhance and simplify the centralized management and sharing of data
storage resources while providing improved availability, scalability,
performance, and disaster recovery. SANs have been enabled by the emergence of
fibre channel, a new generation of server to storage communications
technology. We develop and offer fibre channel host bus adapters and hubs,
high availability software, fibre channel disk storage arrays and management
software for the deployment of SAN solutions.  By reselling fibre channel
hardware and software products from leading manufacturers, together with our
internally developed products, we are able to offer customers a complete
interoperable SAN solution.

Founded in 1968, we have more than 35 years experience in providing
electronic data storage products and solutions.  For more than 30 years we
were a supplier of IBM compatible mainframe computer memory having supplied
memory and related products for seven generations of IBM mainframe computers.
In 1997, in order to diversify our revenue stream as the mainframe memory
market collapsed in the mid-1990s, we entered the fibre channel connectivity
and disk array business.

We sell our products domestically and internationally directly to end users
and through OEM, systems integrator, and value added reseller (VAR) channels.
We sell our memory products directly to end users and through VARs.  Our SAN
products are sold through OEM, systems integrator and VAR channels and to a
limited extent directly to end users.

Our executive offices are located at 115 Flanders Road, Westborough,
Massachusetts 01581.  Our telephone number is (508) 983-1200.  Our Web site
is located at http://www.cambex.com.

                             Industry Background

In today's information-based economy, a company's information and
databases are central to the value of the enterprise. The volume of business-
critical data generated, processed, and stored has grown dramatically over the
last decade.  As a result, the ability to quickly access and manage large
amounts of stored data is one of the most important challenges for
organizations.

Memory

A computer typically accesses stored data from its own internal memory,
internal hard disk drive, or external storage device such as a disk storage
array or tape library.  Memory provides the best performance, but is also the
most expensive per storage unit (megabyte).  Data retrieval from memory is
more than 1000 times faster than retrieval from a disk drive.  As CPU
processing power is doubling every 18 months, data retrieval from disk storage
is increasingly becoming a performance bottleneck.  As a result, applications
and users spend much of their time waiting for the retrieval of data resulting
in lowered productivity.  Recognizing the performance limitations of disk-
based storage, the major server vendors have rearchitected their systems and
processors to allow more data to be stored and accessed directly from memory.
High-end servers from the major vendors (IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-
Packard) now support more than 512 gigabytes of internal main memory.  The
need for fast data access, new servers with large memory capacities, and the
decrease in memory prices is driving demand for memory upgrades.

Memory upgrades for high volume computing systems and devices are typically
packaged as memory modules which conform to standards defining dimensions,
capacity, performance, interface and pin-out. We offer a broad range of
standard memory upgrades, including single in-line memory modules ("SIMMs"),
dual in-line memory modules ("DIMMs") and small outline DIMMs ("SO DIMMs").
Memory modules are compact circuit board assemblies consisting of dynamic
random access memory ("DRAM") chips, which constitute the main memory of a
computer system.

Unlike memory for high volume computing systems, memory upgrades for high-end
servers and mainframes typically involve proprietary designs.  At the high-
end, vendors focus on maximizing the performance, reliability, and diagnostic
capabilities of the unique processor-to-memory architecture of their flagship
products.  This often results in proprietary memory module designs
incorporating custom logic to support very high-speed memory bus protocols,
error detection and correction, and self-test capabilities.

Memory upgrades for computing systems and networking devices are available
from the original equipment manufacturer as well as from third party memory
vendors. In addition to competing with each other, third party vendors
primarily compete with the original equipment manufacturers by providing fully
compatible memory at a much lower price.

Storage Area Networks

Large quantities of business critical data are typically stored on external
disk storage arrays. These disk arrays are either directly attached to the
computer server or are accessed through a network connection. Due to the
significant volume of data being stored in today's business environment,
traditional direct attached and network attached architectures often do not
adequately support the requirements of data-intensive enterprises. In response
to the demand for high-speed and high-reliability storage-to-server
connectivity, the fibre channel interconnect protocol was developed in the

4
<PAGE>

early 1990s.

A storage area network is a network of servers and data storage devices
interconnected via fibre channel at gigabit speeds. SANs provide an open,
extensible platform for storage access in data intensive environments like
those used for web hosting, online transaction processing and data
warehousing. Equally important, SANs can be significantly less expensive to
maintain and expand than traditional storage architectures because they enable
shared, high-speed access to stored data as well as centralized management.

SANs use several basic components to make up the network, including the
following:

	servers and workstations;
	fibre channel host bus adapters;
	fibre channel hubs and/or switches;
	disk and/or tape storage devices;
	copper or fiber optic cables; and
	management software.

All the components must work together to deliver a functional SAN environment.

Each server connects to a SAN through host bus adapters, which are printed
circuit cards that fit in standard sockets on computer motherboards and
enable high-speed data transfer. A host bus adapter connects the server to
other devices in a SAN via cables. The cables connect the host bus adapter
either directly to a fibre channel disk array or tape library or to a hub or a
switch. Because fibre channel host bus adapter functions are regulated by
software, each host bus adapter must include software designed to work with
the particular operating system being used by the server/storage solution.
These systems typically include all types of UNIX as well as Linux and Windows
based operating systems.

Hubs and switches are devices that direct the flow of data from one computing
device to another. When connecting multiple servers to one or more storage
devices, a hub or switch is used to create a fibre channel network. Hubs and
switches simplify cabling and allow the non-disruptive addition or removal of
servers or storage devices from the storage area network.

                               Our Products

Memory Products

We offer a wide range of memory for the add-in memory market. Our add-in
memory is used to upgrade workstations, servers, mainframes, printers,
routers, and other high volume computing and networking products. Our memory
is packaged as memory modules which conform to standards defining dimensions,
capacity, performance, interface and pin-out.  We offer a broad range of
standard memory upgrades, including single in-line memory modules ("SIMMs"),
dual in-line memory modules ("DIMMs") and small outline DIMMs ("SO DIMMs").
Memory modules are compact circuit board assemblies consisting of dynamic
random access memory ("DRAM") chips, which constitute the main memory of a
computer system.

We provide memory upgrade solutions for most of the major servers and
workstations manufactured by IBM, Sun and Hewlett-Packard.  We also sell
memory upgrades for laser printers and Cisco routers.  Our memory products are
designed to the same exacting specifications as original system memory and in
most cases are identical in fit, form and function.

Fibre Channel SAN Products

We are a developer, manufacturer and reseller of fibre channel products that
enable users to deploy SANs. We have developed a family of host bus adapters,
hubs and software that provide increased bandwidth and availability when
deploying mission-critical SANs. Our fibre channel disk arrays allow the
storage of large amounts of online data in a high performance, high
availability environment. By offering other SAN products, including disk
arrays, tape drives and libraries, switches, routers, and software, from other
leading manufacturers, we are able to deliver a complete, tested and
interoperable SAN solution to our customers when required.

Technology

We possess multi-disciplinary technological expertise, which we utilize in
designing our memory and SAN products.

Our expertise in designing memories includes (1) high-availability memory
architecture and design including chip and board level sparing; (2) ASIC
design utilizing high-speed semiconductor technologies and high-density
packaging; and (3) comprehensive manufacturing test procedures - incorporating
functional, thermal, voltage, and mechanical stress.

Our expertise in developing fibre channel SAN products includes software
design and development, embedded hardware design, system design, and systems
integration. We believe that our expertise in these technologies provides us
with competitive advantages in time-to-market, price/performance,
interoperability and product capabilities.

At our principal offices in Westborough, Massachusetts, we have established
a systems integration lab to provide comprehensive functional and system
level integration/interoperability testing between our fibre channel host bus
adapters, hubs, disk arrays, and software with various computer platforms and
fibre channel systems. Integration testing at our lab combines our products
with various fibre channel SAN components to simulate the most commonly used
functional configurations defined by our customers.  The overall goal
is to ensure enterprise class performance and interoperability in real world
SAN deployments.

                                  Customers

We sell our products to OEMs, resellers and directly to end-users. In 2003 and
2004, our largest customers included Hewlett-Packard, StorageTek and Lockheed
Martin.

In the year ended December 31, 2004, our top five customers accounted for
approximately 36% of our total net revenues, and, in the year ended December
31, 2003, our top five customers accounted for approximately 23% of our total
net revenues. During 2004, two customers exceeded 10% of total revenues.
During 2003, no customer exceeded 10% of total revenues. There is no assurance
that current customers will remain our customers in the future and the loss of
a major customer could have a material effect on our business.

                           Customer Service and Support

We offer customer service and support programs that include telephone
and on-site support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition, we have
designed our products to allow easy diagnostics and administration. We employ
systems engineers for pre- and post-sales support and technical support
engineers for field support.

                              Sales and Marketing

We sell our memory products principally to Fortune 1000 corporations, mid-
level businesses, government institutions and resellers. Our sales strategy is
to employ a business-to-business sales model that provides factory direct
orders to end users and resellers. We will continue to focus significant
direct sales efforts on Fortune 1000 enterprises. This sets us apart from most
of our major competitors in the memory upgrade business who sell through
reseller channels. Our goal is to establish ourselves as the vendor of choice
for filling the majority of the memory upgrade needs within large
corporations. Our marketing strategy consists primarily of telemarketing.

We sell our fibre channel SAN products domestically and internationally to
OEMs, systems integrators, and VARs as well as directly to end users in the
United States. We target OEMs, systems integrators, and VARs who resell
complete SAN solutions to end-users. Our sales and marketing strategy will
continue to focus on the development of these indirect channel relationships.

Our marketing efforts are focused on increasing awareness of our fibre
channel products, promoting SAN-based solutions, and advocating industry-wide
standards and interoperability. We plan to participate in industry
associations to promote and further enhance fibre channel technology and
increase our visibility as industry experts. We also plan to participate in
select trade show events and SAN conferences to promote our products and to
continue our efforts to educate potential customers on the value of SANs.

                       Manufacturing, Test and Assembly

We outsource the majority of our manufacturing, and we conduct quality
assurance, manufacturing, engineering, documentation control and certain
finish assembly and test operations at our headquarter facility in
Westborough, Massachusetts. This approach enables us to reduce fixed costs and
to provide flexibility in meeting market demands.

We select suppliers primarily on the basis of technology, manufacturing
capacity, quality and cost. Our reliance on third-party suppliers and
manufacturers involves risks, including possible limitations on availability
of products due to market abnormalities, unavailability of, or delays in
obtaining access to, certain product technologies and the absence of complete
control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and total production
costs. The inability of our suppliers and third party manufacturers to deliver
products of acceptable quality and in a timely manner or our inability to
procure adequate supplies of our products could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition or operating results.

                             Research and Development

Our success will depend to a substantial degree upon our ability to
develop and introduce in a timely fashion new products and enhancements to
our existing products that meet changing customer requirements and emerging
industry standards. We have made, and plan to continue to make, expenditures
for research and development and to participate in the development of
industry standards. However, because our net revenues declined in four of the
five most recently completed fiscal years, our expenditures for research and
development are significantly lower than the amount we expended for research
and development five years ago. Over the last two fiscal years, our
research and development expenses were approximately $690,000 in 2004,
compared to $660,000 in 2003. Research and development expenses primarily
consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing
research, design and development activities and subcontracting costs.

                                   Competition

The markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are
characterized by frequent new product introductions, changing customer
preferences and evolving technology and industry standards. Our competitors
continue to introduce products with improved price/performance
characteristics, and we will have to do the same to remain competitive.
Increased competition could result in significant price competition, reduced
revenues, lower profit margins or loss of market share, any of which would
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and
financial condition.

Our principal competitors in the memory upgrade business are the computer
system original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and third party memory vendors.
The major system OEMs we compete against are International Business Machines
Corporation, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Dell.  The major third
party memory vendors we compete against are Kingston Technology and Dataram.

Our principal competitors in the fibre channel SAN market include Emulex
Corporation, QLogic Corporation and International Business Machines
Corporation.

Some of our OEM and reseller customers could develop products internally that
would replace our products. The loss of opportunities to sell our products to
any such OEM and reseller customers, in addition to the increased competition
presented by these customers, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results and financial condition.

                               Intellectual Property

The intellectual property rights we have in our technology, which generally
consists of programmable hardware logic, software and know-how associated with
our product portfolio, principally arise from our own internal development
efforts. We attempt to protect our technology through a combination of
unpatented trade secrets, trademarks and contractual obligations. Our software
products are protected by copyright laws. We cannot assure that our
intellectual property protection measures will be sufficient to prevent
misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not
independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or
superior to our technology. In addition, the laws of many foreign countries do
not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of
the United States. Our failure to protect our proprietary information could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
operating results.

We may need to initiate litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual
property rights, to protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and
scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in
substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could materially harm our
business. In the future, we may receive notice of infringement claims of other
parties' proprietary rights. Infringement or other claims could be asserted or
prosecuted against us in the future, and it is possible that such assertions
or prosecutions could harm our business. Any such claims, with or without
merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of
technical and management personnel, cause delays in the development and
release of our products, or require us to develop non-infringing technology or
enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Such royalty or licensing
arrangements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or
at all. For these reasons, infringement claims could materially harm our
business.

We have not paid any cash dividends to date, and have no intention of paying
any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The
declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of the
board of directors and to certain limitations imposed by the Massachusetts
Corporation Laws. The timing, amount and form of dividends, if any, will
depend, among other things, on our results of operations, financial
condition, cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board
of directors.

The series 1 bridge note purchase agreement provides that we may not pay cash
dividends as long as the series 1 bridge note remains outstanding.  With the
consent of the holder of the series 1 bridge note and as long as we are not in
default, we may pay dividends to preferred shareholders in accordance with our
articles of organization and we may repurchase shares of our common stock
issued upon the exercise of options granted under our stock option plans.

Set forth in chronological order is information regarding securities
convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock issued by
Cambex within the past three years:

In April through July 2002, we borrowed $125,000 from Joseph F. Kruy and
$50,000 from Richard E. Calvert.  We also entered into separate Loan and
Security Agreements with Messrs. Kruy and Calvert. Our payment obligations
under these Loan and Security Agreements (the "2002 Loan Agreements") are
evidenced by 12% Notes due in April through July 2003.  Under the 2002 Loan
Agreements, we granted each of Messrs. Kruy and Calvert a first priority
security interest in all of our accounts, instruments, documents, general
intangibles, equipment, inventory, and proceeds of any of the foregoing.
Under the terms of the 2002 Loan Agreements, Messrs. Kruy and Calvert received
a warrant to purchase up one share of common stock for each dollar loaned to
us, at an exercise price of $0.25 per share. We believe that the borrowing
arrangements we made with Mr. Kruy and others were on terms at least as
favorable to us as we would have expected from lenders unrelated to us. On
June 28, 2002, in transactions exempt under Section 4(2) of the Securities

10
<PAGE>

Act, Joseph F. Kruy, Richard E. Calvert, H. Terry Snowday, Jr., and Philip
Hankins converted Loan and Security Agreements with an aggregate principal
amount of $1,000,000 plus accrued interest into Series A Convertible Preferred
stock. They were issued 98,223 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock.
The Series A Convertible Preferred shares have a dividend rate of 12%. The
purchase price per share of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock was
$12.50. The Series A Preferred stock is convertible into shares of common
stock, at any time at the holder's option. The holders of the 98,223 shares of
Series A Preferred stock could convert their preferred shares into 982,230
shares of common stock. In June through August 2003, we borrowed $200,000 from
Joseph F. Kruy.  We also entered into Loan and Security Agreements with Mr.
Kruy. Our payment obligations under these Loan and Security Agreements (the
"2003 Loan Agreements") are evidenced by 12% Notes due in June through August
2004.  Under the 2003 Loan Agreements, we granted Mr. Kruy a first priority
security interest in all of our accounts, instruments, documents, general
intangibles, equipment, inventory, and proceeds of any of the foregoing. We
believe that the borrowing arrangements we made with Mr. Kruy were on terms at
least as favorable to us as we would have expected from lenders unrelated to
us.  As of March 24, 2005, the balance outstanding under Loan and Security
Agreements is $475,000 of which $325,000 is owed to Joseph F. Kruy and $50,000
is owed to Richard E. Calvert.

Joseph F. Kruy, Philip C. Hankins, Richard E. Calvert and H. Terry Snowday,
Jr. are all accredited investors and have provided us written representations
to that effect.

We had no repurchases of equity securities in the fourth quarter of 2004.

     Item 6.  Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation.


The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this
Form 10-KSB.  Please refer to "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements" for additional information.


Comparison of fiscal years 2004 and 2003

Our revenues were $3,317,000 and $9,528,000 for 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Revenues for 2004 decreased 65% compared to revenues for the prior year due to
decreased memory product sales by our discontinued subsidiary which was
partially offset by increased sales of our fibre channel connectivity
products. The decreased memory sales were primarily the result of selling our
WINTEL business.

Gross profit rate was 64% of revenues in 2004, compared to 40% of revenues in
2003. The increase was due to the product mix as there are higher gross
margins on our fibre channel connectivity products and software than our
memory products.

Operating expenses in 2004 decreased by 53% in comparison to operating
expenses in the prior year.  Selling and General and Administrative expenses
for 2004 decreased by 78% and 14% respectively compared to the amount of these
expenses in 2003 due to reductions in personnel and related expenses of our
subsidiary.

Other income (expense) in 2004 includes $793,000 of income from the sale by
our subsidiary of a portion of its customer information and rights to do
business with said customers with respect to WINTEL business, $275,000 of loss

11
<PAGE>

from discontinuance of operations, $100,000 of final foreign currency
translation adjustment, $350,000 of income from the write-off of accrued
liabilities and $205,000 of interest expense. Other income (expense) in 2003
consists of other income of $98,000 relating to the reversal of accrued
expenses and $252,000 of interest expense.

Total comprehensive income for 2004 was $1,145,000 or $0.06 per share, as
compared with total comprehensive income of $119,000, or $0.01 per share, for
2003.


Critical Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition

We manufacture equipment for sale or lease.  We follow the guidance in Staff
Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 104 in applying generally accepted accounting
principles to revenue recognition in consolidated financial statements. We
include items in revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility
is reasonably assured. The "obligations for trade-in memory" were determined
in each contract when we took mainframe memory in trade when we installed our
mainframe memory in our customers' computers. The amount remaining in this
account is an obligation for product credit which was established when
mainframe memory was traded-in for the purchase of memory.

Stock-Based Compensation

SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", encourages but does
not require companies to record compensation cost for stock-based employee
compensation plans at fair value.  We have chosen to continue to account for
such plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25.  Accordingly, compensation cost for stock
options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of our
stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the stock (See Note 10).

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS
No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS No.
151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that
abnormal amounts of idle facility, freight, handling costs and wasted
materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. In
addition, this statement requires that allocation of fixed production
overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. This statement is effective for inventory costs
incurred in the first annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005.
Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have a material
impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
123R "Share-Based Payment", which replaces SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB
Opinion No. 25. SFAS No. 123R will require the compensation cost relating to
share-based payment transactions to be recognized in financial statements. The
cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability
instruments issued. SFAS No. 123R is effective for small business issuers in
the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after December 15,
2005. Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have a
material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

12
<PAGE>

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
SFAS No. 153, "Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets", which is an amendment to APB
Opinion No. 29. The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for
Nonmonetary Transactions", is based on the principle that exchanges of
nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets
exchanged. The guidance in that opinion, however, included certain exceptions
to that principle. This statement amends APB Opinion No. 29 to eliminate the
exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces
it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not
have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if
the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a
result of the exchange. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 is not expected to have a
material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Inflation

We did not experience any material adverse effects in 2003 or 2004 due to
general inflation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During 2004, net cash provided by operating activities was $902,130. Net cash
provided by investing activities, related to sale of customer information and
rights, was $70,000. Net cash used in financing activities was $826,639,
relating primarily to repayments under the line of credit and loan agreement.

We have a loan and security agreement with B.A. Associates, Inc. which is a
corporation owned by Bruce D. Rozelle, a son-in-law of Joseph F. Kruy, our
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer under which we may borrow up
to $1,100,000. The outstanding balance due to B.A. Associates, Inc. was
$791,923 at December 31, 2004.  We also have notes payable of $724,643 at
December 31, 2004 which include $475,000 of advances payable which are due on
demand. The $475,000 of advances payable includes $375,000 of borrowings from
related parties. The notes payable balance of $249,643 includes $150,000 of
the series 1 bridge financing note and $99,643 of accounts payable converted
to notes payable.

Our cash was $314,000 and $269,000 at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003,
respectively. Working capital was a deficit of $4,324,000 and $5,772,000 at
December 31, 2004 and at December 31, 2003, respectively. During 2004, we did
not expend any funds for capital equipment. During fiscal 2005, we expect to
acquire less than $100,000 of capital equipment.

Our profitability and liquidity depends upon being able to maintain present
revenue and gross profit levels. Management has also been working to secure
additional capital. There is no assurance that such capital will be raised.

determined that there are no material weaknesses in internal controls. There
were no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that
could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of our
most recent evaluation.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the
Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of
a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of
ownership and changes in ownership of common stock (Forms 3, 4 and 5) with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers, directors and greater-than-ten-
percent holders are required to furnish the Company with copies of all such
forms, which they have filed.

	Based solely upon a review of Forms 3 and Forms 4 furnished to the
Company during the most recent fiscal year, and Forms 5 with respect to its
most recent fiscal year, we believe that all such forms required to be filed
pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act were timely filed, as necessary,
by the officers, directors and security holders required to file the same
during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.



                      Item 10.  Executive Compensation.

The following table provides certain summary information concerning
compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to our Chief Executive Officer and

Employment Contracts and Termination Agreements

We entered into an employment agreement with Joseph F. Kruy on November
18, 1994.  An extension of the term of this employment agreement to December
31, 2006 was approved by our board of directors in April 2003. Under his
employment agreement, Mr. Kruy is engaged to serve as our Chairman of the
Board, President and Chief Executive Officer.  Except for illness, reasonable
vacations and other customary exceptions, during the term of the agreement,
Mr. Kruy is to devote all of his working time and attention to the performance
of his duties and responsibilities at Cambex.  Mr. Kruy is to be
paid a minimum annual base salary of $200,000 per year.  Mr. Kruy is also
entitled to participate in our Incentive Bonus Plan and is eligible to
receive an annual bonus up to 4% of our pre-tax profit, as that term is
defined in the Incentive Bonus Plan.  If Mr. Kruy voluntarily terminates his
employment with us, he is entitled to receive his base annual compensation
through the date of termination and any amount that he may be entitled to
receive under the Incentive Bonus Plan in accordance with the terms of that
Plan.  If, after Mr. Kruy voluntarily terminates his employment with us, he
accepts employment during the remaining then current term of his agreement
with an entity that directly competes with us, then we may cease paying Mr.
Kruy any further amounts.  If we terminate Mr. Kruy's employment for reasons
other than for cause or if we give another person either the title or the
powers of the Chief Executive Officer, then Mr. Kruy is entitled to continue
to receive his annual base salary through the end of the then current term of
the agreement, and is entitled to receive any incentive bonus that would have

17
<PAGE>

been earned under the Incentive Bonus Plan during the fiscal year in which
his employment was terminated.  If, following termination of Mr. Kruy's
employment with us, he accepts employment elsewhere before December 31, 2006,
then we do not have to continue to pay Mr. Kruy for the year ending December
31, 2006.  Moreover, if on the date of termination of Mr. Kruy's employment
with us, our assets are in the hands of a receiver, an assignee for the
benefit of creditors, trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession or other
entity for the benefit of creditors or if our consolidated net worth is less
than our consolidated net worth at December 31, 1999, then we have no
obligation to pay Mr. Kruy any amount after termination of his employment.

We compensate our non-employee directors with an annual fee of $10,000 and a
fee of $1,000 for each meeting of the board of directors attended. In August
1998, the board of directors authorized the non-employee director compensation
to be converted from cash to shares of our common stock at a price of $0.25
per share, or 50% of the fair market value, whichever is greater. To date, no
shares have been issued to the non-employee directors as compensation for
services as a member of the board of directors.

*		Represents beneficial ownership of less than 1%.

(1) Beneficial ownership for purposes of the table is determined in
accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is
not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose.  In
computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the
percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock issuable upon the
exercise of options and warrants held by that person that are currently
exercisable or exercisable within 60 days following March 24, 2004 (May 23,
2004) are deemed to be outstanding. These shares, however, are not considered
outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other
person.  Except as indicated in the footnotes, we believe that the persons and
entities named in the table have sole voting and sole investment power with
respect to all shares beneficially owned by them, subject to community
property laws where applicable.

(2) Percentage of ownership is based on 18,729,189 shares of common stock
outstanding as of March 24, 2005.

(3) Includes 610,103 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of stock
purchase warrants exercisable within 60 days following March 24, 2005 (or by
May 23, 2005).  Includes 270,200 shares of common stock issuable upon
conversion of Series A Preferred stock issued in 2002. This number also
includes 56,250 shares held by the Kruy Family Trust, for which Mr. Kruy's
wife and children are the beneficial owners.  Mr. Kruy disclaims beneficial
ownership of these shares.  Of these shares of common stock, 979,239 are
subject to the terms of a stock pledge agreement dated as of January 18, 2000
(the "Kruy Pledge Agreement"), among Joseph F. Kruy, Cambex and SovCap Equity
Partners, Ltd., Arab Commerce Bank Ltd., and Correllus International Ltd.
Provided that Cambex is not in default under the series 1 bridge note purchase
agreement dated as of January 18, 2000 (the "Bridge Note Purchase Agreement"),
among Cambex and SovCap Equity Partners, Ltd., Arab Commerce Bank Ltd., and
Correllus International Ltd., the series 1 bridge financing notes issued
pursuant to the Bridge Note Purchase Agreement, or the Kruy Pledge Agreement,
Mr. Kruy has the right to vote the pledged shares.

(4) Includes 812,000 shares issuable upon exercise of stock purchase warrants
exercisable within 60 days following March 24, 2005 (or by May 23, 2005).
Also, includes 469,200 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of
Series A Preferred stock issued in 2002.

(5) Includes 312,000 shares issuable upon exercise of stock purchase warrants
exercisable within 60 days following March 24, 2005 (or by May 23, 2005). Some
of these warrants are held by family members and Mr. Snowday disclaims
beneficial ownership of those shares. Includes 107,610 shares of common stock
issuable upon conversion of Series A Preferred stock issued in 2002.

          Item 12.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.



On March 29, 2002, Joseph F. Kruy, Richard E. Calvert, H. Terry Snowday, Jr.
and a person unrelated to the company converted their 10% Subordinated
Convertible Promissory Notes and accrued interest into common stock. They were
issued 7,540,871 shares of common stock at $0.22 per share. As of December 31,
2002 none of the 10% Notes remained outstanding.

On November 9, 1998, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with
B.A. Associates, Inc. (BAA), which is a corporation owned by Bruce Rozelle, a
son-in-law of Joseph F. Kruy, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer.  This Loan and Security Agreement, as amended by a First Amendment to
Loan and Security Agreement dated March 15, 1999, and further amended through

20
<PAGE>

December 27, 2001 (as so amended, the "BAA Loan Agreement"), allows us to
borrow up to $1,100,000, which is the maximum that may be outstanding at any
one time. Under the BAA Loan Agreement, we granted BAA a first priority
security interest in all of our accounts, instruments, documents, general
intangibles, equipment, inventory, and proceeds of any of the foregoing.  We
are obligated to pay all amounts that we receive from collections of our
accounts receivable to BAA not less frequently than each week until the
outstanding loan amount plus interest, which accrues at a 12% annual rate, is
fully paid.  Under the terms of the BAA Loan Agreement, originally BAA
received a warrant for the purchase of 1.3 million shares of common stock, at
an exercise price of $0.22 per share.  In consideration for increasing the
amount of available funds, the Company agreed to issue an additional warrant
to BAA for the purchase of 400,000 shares of our common stock, at an exercise
price of $1.25 per share.  We believe that the borrowing arrangements we made
with BAA were on terms at least as favorable to us as we would have expected
from lenders unrelated to us and relatives of Mr. Kruy.

In April through July 2002, we borrowed $125,000 from Joseph F. Kruy and
$50,000 from Richard E. Calvert.  We also entered into separate Loan and
Security Agreements with Messrs. Kruy and Calvert. Our payment obligations
under these Loan and Security Agreements (the "2002 Loan Agreements") are
evidenced by 12% Notes due in April through July 2003.  Under the 2002 Loan
Agreements, we granted each of Messrs. Kruy and Calvert a first priority
security interest in all of our accounts, instruments, documents, general
intangibles, equipment, inventory, and proceeds of any of the foregoing.
Under the terms of the 2002 Loan Agreements, Messrs. Kruy and Calvert received
a warrant to purchase up one share of common stock for each dollar loaned to
us, at an exercise price of $0.25 per share. We believe that the borrowing
arrangements we made with Mr. Kruy and others were on terms at least as
favorable to us as we would have expected from lenders unrelated to us. On
June 28, 2002, in transactions exempt under Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act, Joseph F. Kruy, Richard E. Calvert, H. Terry Snowday, Jr., and Philip
Hankins converted Loan and Security Agreements with an aggregate principal
amount of $1,000,000 plus accrued interest into Series A Convertible Preferred
stock. They were issued 98,223 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock.
The Series A Convertible Preferred shares have a dividend rate of 12%. The
purchase price per share of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock was
$12.50. The Series A Preferred stock is convertible into shares of common
stock, at any time at the holder's option. The holders of the 98,223 shares of
Series A Preferred stock could convert their preferred shares into 982,230
shares of common stock. In June through August 2003, we borrowed $200,000 from
Joseph F. Kruy.  We also entered into Loan and Security Agreements with Mr.
Kruy. Our payment obligations under these Loan and Security Agreements (the
"2003 Loan Agreements") are evidenced by 12% Notes due in June through August
2004.  Under the 2003 Loan Agreements, we granted Mr. Kruy a first priority
security interest in all of our accounts, instruments, documents, general
intangibles, equipment, inventory, and proceeds of any of the foregoing. We
believe that the borrowing arrangements we made with Mr. Kruy were on terms at
least as favorable to us as we would have expected from lenders unrelated to
us.  As of December 31, 2004, the balance outstanding under Loan and Security
Agreements is $475,000 of which $325,000 is owed to Joseph F. Kruy and $50,000
is owed to Richard E. Calvert.

permanent employees.

                 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders of Cambex Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Cambex
Corporation (a Massachusetts corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' investment and cash flows for the years then ended.  These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cambex
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

                     CAMBEX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                         December 31, 2004 and 2003

(1)   Business Operations

We are a designer and supplier of data storage products and solutions.  Our
products include memory for computing systems and fibre channel connectivity
and storage products used to build storage area networks (SANs).

We sell our products to OEMs, resellers and directly to end-users. In 2003 and
2004, our largest customers included Hewlett-Packard, StorageTek and Lockheed
Martin.

In the year ended December 31, 2003, our top five customers accounted
for approximately 23% of our total net revenues, and, in the year ended
December 31, 2004, our top five customers accounted for approximately 36% of
our total net revenues. During 2003, no customer exceeded 10% of total
revenues. During 2004, two customers exceeded 10% of total revenues. There is
no assurance that current customers will remain our customers in the future
and the loss of a major customer could have a material effect on our business.


(2)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Cambex Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2004,
all remaining subsidiaries are inactive. All material intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition

We manufacture equipment for sale or lease.  We follow the guidance in Staff
Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 104 in applying generally accepted accounting
principles to revenue recognition in consolidated financial statements. We
include items in revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility
is reasonably assured. The "obligations for trade-in memory" were determined
in each contract when we took mainframe memory in trade when we installed our
mainframe memory in our customers' computers. The amount remaining in this
account is an obligation for product credit which was established when
mainframe memory was traded-in for the purchase of memory.

Inventories

Inventories, which include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead, are
stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market and consist of the
following:

                                 (Continued)

(2)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Continued

Property and Equipment

We provide for depreciation and amortization on a straight- line basis to
amortize the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives
as follows:

             Machinery and equipment         3- 8 Years
             Furniture and fixtures          3- 8 Years

Maintenance and repair items are charged to expense when incurred; renewals or
betterments are capitalized.

If property is sold or otherwise disposed of, our policy is to remove the
related cost and accumulated depreciation from the accounts and to include any
resulting gain or loss in income.

Depreciation expense of $866 and $15,713, was recorded for the periods ended
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively.

Net Income Per Common Share

Basic income per share amounts are based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during each year. Diluted income per share amounts
are based on the weighted average number of common shares and common share
equivalents outstanding during each year to the extent such equivalents have a
dilutive effect on the income per share.

For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, common share equivalents
(options, warrants and convertible preferred stock) were not included in
diluted income per share because the inclusion of the common stock equivalents
would have had an antidilutive effect on the computation of diluted income per
share.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are recorded at cost which approximates market value
and includes instruments purchased with maturities of less than three months.

Stock Options

Proceeds from the sale of newly issued stock to employees under our stock
option plans are credited to common stock to the extent of par value and the
excess to capital in excess of par value.

Disclosures about the Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments consist mainly of cash, cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, notes payable, a line of credit and a revolving
credit agreement.  The carrying amounts of these financial instruments
approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and
expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, goodwill
cannot be amortized. However, a test for impairment must be performed
annually, or immediately, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
such an impairment could exist. The goodwill impairment test has two steps. We
identify potential impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting
unit with its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the
book value, goodwill is considered not impaired and the second step of the
impairment test is not necessary. If the book value exceeds its fair value,
the second step calculates the possible impairment loss by comparing the
implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount. If the implied
goodwill is less than the carrying amount, a write-down is recorded. As of
December 31, 2004, the Company no longer has goodwill.

Foreign Currency Translation

The financial statements of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are generally
measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Net exchange
gains or losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of
foreign operations are recorded as a separate component of stockholders'
investment as other comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS No. 130,
"Reporting Comprehensive Income". As the Company's subsidiaries are no longer
active, the other comprehensive income balance was reversed in 2004.

Segment Reporting

SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information," became effective for periods beginning after December 31, 1997.
This statement requires the presentment of information about the identifiable
components comprising an enterprise's business activities.

We have determined that there are no separately reportable operating segments
and, therefore, do not present separate reporting segments in the consolidated
financial statements.

(2)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Continued

Stock-Based Compensation

SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", encourages but does
not require companies to record compensation cost for stock-based employee
compensation plans at fair value.  We have chosen to continue to account for
such plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25.  Accordingly, compensation cost for stock
options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of our
stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the stock (See Note 8).

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS
No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS No.
151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that
abnormal amounts of idle facility, freight, handling costs and wasted
materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. In
addition, this statement requires that allocation of fixed production
overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. This statement is effective for inventory costs
incurred in the first annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005.
Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have a material
impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
123R "Share-Based Payment", which replaces SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB
Opinion No. 25. SFAS No. 123R will require the compensation cost relating to
share-based payment transactions to be recognized in financial statements. The
cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability
instruments issued. SFAS No. 123R is effective for small business issuers in
the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after December 15,
2005. Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have a
material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
SFAS No. 153, "Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets", which is an amendment to APB
Opinion No. 29. The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for
Nonmonetary Transactions", is based on the principle that exchanges of
nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets
exchanged. The guidance in that opinion, however, included certain exceptions
to that principle. This statement amends APB Opinion No. 29 to eliminate the
exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces
it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not
have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if
the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a
result of the exchange. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 is not expected to have a
material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

(3)  Income Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting For Income Taxes", deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the
financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax
rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.

The following table presents a reconciliation between taxes provided at the
statutory federal income tax rate and the actual tax provision recorded for
the following periods:

                                 (Continued)

(4)   Short Term Borrowings

We have a loan and security agreement with a related party referred to in Note
11. The outstanding balance due to the related party was $791,923 and
$1,033,016 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Notes payable of $724,643 at December 31, 2004 and $784,699 at December 31,
2003 include $475,000 of advances payable which are due on demand. The
$475,000 of advances payable includes amounts of $375,000 from related
parties. These notes are further described in Note 10. The balances of
$249,643 and $309,669 as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 include
$99,643 and $159,669, respectively, of accounts payable converted to notes
payable and $150,000 of series 1 bridge financing notes issued in 2000.

The series 1 bridge financing notes bore interest at the rate of 8% per annum
prior to maturity. Since maturity, interest is accruing on these notes at a
rate of 12% per annum. These bridge notes are convertible into shares of our
common stock at any time at a weighted average per share price of $4.08.
Following conversion of the bridge notes, if Arab Commerce Bank Ltd. does not
realize at least a 20% gain on shares of common stock that they choose to sell
during the 90 days following conversion, then Arab Commerce Bank Ltd. is
entitled to acquire additional shares of common stock at a price of $0.10 per
share through the exercise of repricing warrants.  In addition to these bridge
notes and the attached repricing warrants, we issued warrants to purchase
300,000 shares of common stock. These warrants have a weighted average
exercise price of $4.54 per share. There is no value associated with these
warrants recorded on our books.


(5)   Earnings Per Share

Earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the average number
of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during the year. The
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003 were approximately 18,320,000.

Common stock equivalents include the net additional number of shares that
would be issuable upon the exercise of the outstanding common stock options
and warrants (see Note 8) and conversion of preferred stock, assuming that we
reinvested the proceeds to purchase additional shares at market value. Common
stock equivalents also include shares of common stock that would be issuable
upon conversion of subordinated promissory convertible notes.

Options and warrants to purchase 6,036,865 and 8,096,029 weighted average
shares of common stock during the years ended December 31, 2004 and December
31, 2003, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted income
per share because to do so would have had an antidilutive effect on the
computation of income per share. Weighted average shares issuable from
convertible notes of 24,630 were not included in the diluted earnings per
share because to do so would have had an antidilutive effect on the
computation of earnings per share.

(5)   Earnings Per Share - Continued

As more fully described in Note 8, options and warrants to purchase 4,714,903
and 7,434,403 shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively, and 24,630 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion
of notes outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003 could potentially dilute
basic income (loss) per share in the future.


(6) Preferred Stock

We are authorized to issue up to 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $1.00
par value per share, of which 245,463 shares are issued and outstanding as of
December 31,2004. Of the 245,463 preferred shares outstanding, 98,223 shares
are Series A Convertible Preferred shares and 147,240 shares are Series B
Convertible Preferred shares. Both the Series A and Series B Convertible
Preferred shares have a dividend rate of 12%, when and if declared by the
Company's Board of Directors. Holders of shares of both Series A and Series B
Preferred stock are not entitled to any voting rights for any shares of Series
A or Series B Preferred stock which they hold.  Both the Series A and Series B
Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of common stock, at any time at
the holder's option. The holder's of the 98,223 shares of Series A Preferred
Stock could convert their preferred shares into 982,230 shares of common
stock. The 147,240 shares of Series B Preferred stock are convertible into up
to a total of 1,525,939 shares of our common stock. The holders of the Series
B Convertible Preferred stock were granted registration rights for the
underlying common stock into which the Preferred is convertible. In 2005,
30,000 shares of Preferred Stock were converted into 408,838 shares of common
stock.


(7)   Commitments and Contingencies

At December 31, 2004, we had minimum rental commitments under long-term,
noncancelable operating leases for facilities and other equipment as follows:

            Due during Fiscal Year


                  2005              $  163,916

                  Total             $  792,667

Total rental expense, including the cost of short-term equipment leases, real
estate taxes and insurance paid to the landlord and charged to operations
approximated $201,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $562,000 for
the year ended December 31, 2003.

(8)   Stock Options and Warrants

On March 24,1987, we established the 1987 Stock Option Plan and 32,800 options
to purchase shares of our common stock were outstanding as of December 31,
2004. On March 7, 1997, we established the 1997 Stock Option Plan. As of
December 31, 2004, there were 464,000 options to purchase shares of our common
stock outstanding under the 1997 Plan. On November 12, 1999, the 1997 Plan was
cancelled. On November 12, 1999, we established and on December 23, 1999,
shareholders approved the Year 2000 Equity Incentive Plan. The Year 2000
Equity Incentive Plan provides for the issuance of up to 1,500,000 shares of
our common stock and 617,000 options to purchase shares of our common stock
were outstanding as of December 31, 2004. The Year 2000 Equity Incentive Plan
replaces the 1997 Plan for all future options. At December 31, 2004, we had
three stock option plans for officers and certain employees under which
1,996,800 shares were reserved and options for 883,000 shares were available
for future grants.  Options are granted at not less than 85%, or in certain
cases, not less than 100%, of the fair market value of the common stock on the
date of grant.  Options outstanding have a term of ten years and become
exercisable in installments as determined by the Board of Directors. The
plans' options vest between one through six years and all expire between March
4, 2006 and November 11, 2014.

Stock option activity for the two years ended December 31, 2004 was as

shares of common stock at weighted average prices of $1.02 per share were
outstanding and an equal number of shares were reserved for issuance.

 (9)   Incentive Bonus Plan and 401(k) Profit Sharing Retirement Plan

We have an incentive bonus plan under which certain key employees as a group
are entitled to receive additional compensation up to a maximum of 15% of our
pre-tax income, as defined.  There was a $25,000 provision for additional
compensation in 2004 and no provision for additional compensation in 2003.

On September 1, 1988, we established the Cambex Corporation 401(k) Profit
Sharing Retirement Plan (the Plan).  Under the Plan, employees are allowed to
make pre-tax retirement contributions.  In addition, we may provide matching
contributions based on pre-established rates. Each year the Board of Directors
determines whether matching contributions will be made and in what amounts.
There was no matching contribution in 2004 or 2003.

We offer no post-retirement benefits other than those provided under the Plan.


(10)  Related Party Transactions

On November 9, 1998, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with
B.A. Associates, Inc. (BAA), which is a corporation owned Bruce D. Rozelle, a
son-in-law  of Joseph F. Kruy, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer.  This Loan and Security Agreement, as amended by a First Amendment to
Loan and Security Agreement dated March 15, 1999, and further amended through
December 27, 2001 (as so amended, the "BAA Loan Agreement"), allows us to
borrow up to  $1,100,000, which is the maximum that may be outstanding at any
one time. Under the BAA Loan Agreement, we granted BAA a first priority
security interest in all of our accounts, instruments, documents, general
intangibles, equipment, inventory, and proceeds of any of the foregoing.  We
pay all amounts that we receive from collections of our accounts receivable to
BAA not less frequently than each week until the outstanding loan amount plus
interest, which accrues at a 12% annual rate, is fully paid.  Under the terms
of the BAA Loan Agreement, originally BAA received a warrant for the purchase
of 1.3 million shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $0.22 per
share.  In consideration for increasing the amount of available funds, the
Company agreed to issue an additional warrant to BAA for the purchase of
400,000 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of $1.25 per share.
We believe that the borrowing arrangements we made with BAA were on terms at
least as favorable to us as we would have expected from lenders unrelated to
us and relatives of Mr. Kruy.

(10)  Related Party Transactions - Continued

In April through July 2002, we borrowed $125,000 from Joseph F. Kruy and
$50,000 from Richard E. Calvert.  We also entered into separate Loan and
Security Agreements with Messrs. Kruy and Calvert. Our payment obligations
under these Loan and Security Agreements (the "2002 Loan Agreements") are
evidenced by 12% Notes due in April through July 2003.  Under the 2002 Loan
Agreements, we granted each of Messrs. Kruy and Calvert a first priority
security interest in all of our accounts, instruments, documents, general
intangibles, equipment, inventory, and proceeds of any of the foregoing.
Under the terms of the 2002 Loan Agreements, Messrs. Kruy and Calvert received
a warrant to purchase up to one share of common stock for each dollar loaned
to us, at an exercise price of $0.25 per share. We believe that the borrowing
arrangements we made with Mr. Kruy and others were on terms at least as
favorable to us as we would have expected from lenders unrelated to us.

In June through August 2003, we borrowed $200,000 from Joseph F. Kruy.  We
also entered into Loan and Security Agreements with Mr. Kruy. Our payment
obligations under these Loan and Security Agreements (the "2003 Loan
Agreements") are evidenced by 12% Notes due in June through August 2004.
Under the 2003 Loan Agreements, we granted Mr. Kruy a first priority security
interest in all of our accounts, instruments, documents, general intangibles,
equipment, inventory, and proceeds of any of the foregoing. We believe that
the borrowing arrangements we made with Mr. Kruy were on terms at least as
favorable to us as we would have expected from lenders unrelated to us.
As of December 31, 2004, the balance outstanding under these Loan Agreements
is $475,000 of which $325,000 is owed to Joseph F. Kruy and $50,000 is owed to
Richard E. Calvert.


(11)Purchase Agreement

On January 30, 2004, Super PC Memory, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Cambex Corporation, entered into an agreement with Silicon Mountain Memory
Incorporated, a privately-held company, pursuant to which Silicon Mountain
Memory Incorporated purchased a portion of Super PC Memory's customer
information and rights to do business with said customers with respect to
Wintel products. Sales to said customers with respect to Wintel products was a
substantial portion of our revenues in 2003 and 2002. These sales were sales
with lower gross margins. The total purchase price is $1,050,000 subject to
allocation as to cash or note payments, the exact amount and terms
of payment is dependent upon the revenues generated by Silicon Mountain Memory
from Super PC Memory customers. The first payment of $35,000 was received at
closing. According to terms of the agreement, beginning on May 15, 2004, and
on or before the 15th of each month, Silicon Mountain Memory will make a
payment to Super PC Memory based upon gross profit for the preceding month
according to the following formula: if the gross profit is less than $100,000,
the payment will be 25% of gross profit; if the gross profit is between
$100,000 and $140,000, the payment will be $35,000; and if the gross profit is
in excess of $140,000, the payment will be 35% of gross profit. A payment of
$35,000 was received in May. The Company recorded other income of $792,628
from this transaction during the quarter ended April 4, 2004.

(12)Discontinuance of Super PC Memory, Inc. Operations

On May 21, 2004, the Company's Super PC Memory, Inc. subsidiary discontinued
its operations and executed an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors.  The
purpose of the Assignment is to provide an orderly liquidation of Super PC's
assets and distribution of the proceeds to Super PC's creditors.  Super PC's
assets primarily consist of inventory, receivables, fixed assets and a
Purchase Agreement for the sale of Super PC's customer base relating to Wintel
Products and rights to do business with said customers. The Company recorded a
loss of $275,161 during the quarter ended April 4, 2004 on this transaction.

The Assignee is Maximum Asset Recovery Services, Inc., a Los Angeles,
California based financial consulting and management firm.  Maximum Asset
Recovery Services, Inc. has no relationship to Super PC Memory, Cambex
Corporation or any of their affiliates.

The Company acquired Super PC Memory in March 2002. Super PC Memory incurred
substantial operating losses in fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 to date.
Due to unfavorable memory market conditions, Super PC's cost structure could
not be supported by the revenues and gross profit Super PC could generate.
Consequently, Super PC Memory executed an Assignment for the Benefit of
Creditors. Cambex Corporation and its other subsidiaries are unaffected by the
Super PC Memory action. However, the Assignment will significantly reduce the
Company's revenues. On the other hand, it also will reduce its operating costs
and positively impact its cash flow.

                                 RISK FACTORS

                         Risks Related to Our Business


We have developed relationships with potential OEM, distribution channel and
end user customers and a decision by any one of these potential customers not
to purchase our products, or any cancellation or delay of orders that may be
placed by any of these potential customers may have a significant and adverse
affect on our net revenues

    Historically, a limited number of OEMs, distribution channel and end user
customers have accounted for a significant majority of our total net revenues
in each fiscal period.  For example, sales to our top five customers
accounted for approximately 36% and 23% percent of net revenues for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  We have
established relationships with a small number of potential OEM, distribution
channel and end user customers.  If any one of these potential customers
decides not to purchase our products or decides to purchase our products in
quantities that are below our expectations, then our net revenues will be
adversely affected.  We have and expect to continue to experience substantial
period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results because, among
other factors, we depend to a significant extent upon revenues from a small
number of customers.

    Our sales cycle typically involves a lengthy qualification cycle during
which there is a need to expend significant resources in addressing customer
specifications.  Because of the length of the sales cycle, we may experience
a delay between increasing expenses for research and development and sales
and marketing efforts and the generation of higher revenues, if any, from
such expenditures.  The purchase of our products or of solutions that
incorporate our products typically involves significant internal procedures
associated with the evaluation, testing, implementation and acceptance of new
technologies.  This evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales
process, typically ranging from three months to longer than a year, and
subjects the sales cycle associated with the purchase of our products to a
number of significant risks, including budgetary constraints and internal
acceptance reviews. The length of our sales cycle also varies substantially
from customer to customer.

    Because we anticipate that none of our potential customers will be, and
none of our current customers are, contractually obligated to purchase any
fixed amount of products from us in the future, they may stop placing orders
with us at any time, regardless of any forecast they may have previously
provided.  If any of our significant customers stop or delay purchases, our
revenues and operating results would be adversely affected, which could cause
our stock price to decline.  We cannot be certain that we will retain our
current OEM, distribution channel or end user customers or that we will be
able to recruit additional or replacement customers.  As is common in an
emerging technology industry, agreements with OEMs and distribution channel
customers are typically non-exclusive and often may be terminated by either
party without cause.  Moreover, many OEM and distribution channel customers
carry competing product lines.  If we were to suddenly lose one or more
important OEM, distribution channel or end user customers or potential
customers to a competitor, our business, operating results or financial

1
<PAGE>

condition could be materially adversely affected.  Moreover, OEM customers
could develop products internally that would replace our products.  The
resulting reduction in sales of our products to any OEM customers, in
addition to the increased competition presented by these customers, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or
financial condition.


The failure of OEM customers to keep pace with rapid technological change and
to successfully develop and introduce new products could adversely affect our
net revenues

    Our ability to generate increased revenues depends significantly upon the
ability and willingness of OEM customers to develop and promote products on a
timely basis that incorporate our technology.  If OEM customers do not
successfully develop and market the solutions that incorporate our products,
then sales of our products to OEM customers will be adversely affected.  The
ability and willingness of OEM customers to develop and promote such products
is based upon a number of factors beyond our control.


Delays in product development could adversely affect our market position or
customer relationships

    We have experienced delays in product development in the past and may
experience similar delays in the future.  Given the short product life cycles
in the markets for our products, any delay or unanticipated difficulty
associated with new product introductions or product enhancements could cause
us to lose customers and damage our competitive position.  Prior delays have
resulted from numerous factors, such as:

      changing product specifications;
      difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary personnel;
      difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and other
      resource limitations;
      lack of adequate capital to fund product development efforts;
      difficulties with independent contractors;
      changing market or competitive product requirements;
      unanticipated engineering complexity;
      undetected errors or failures in software and hardware; and
      delays in the acceptance or shipment of products by customers.


We expect the average selling prices and associated gross margins of our
products to continue to decrease, which may reduce our revenues or gross
profits

    The markets for memory, fibre channel connectivity and disk storage
products have experienced erosion of average selling prices and gross margins
due to a number of factors, including competitive pricing pressures and rapid
technological change. The gross margins for our memory products is lower than
the gross margins for our fibre channel connectivity and disk storage
products. We may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in
future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices. We
anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in
the future in response to competitive pricing pressures, increased sales
discounts, new product introductions by us or our competitors or other

2
<PAGE>

factors.  Therefore, to maintain our gross margins, we must develop and
introduce on a timely basis, new products and product enhancements and
continually reduce our product costs.  Our failure to do so would cause our
revenue and gross margins to decline, which could materially adversely affect
our operating results and cause the price of our common stock to decline.


If our business improves rapidly, our operations may be negatively impacted
and we may be required to incur substantial costs to upgrade our
infrastructure. We may need additional working capital financing and we may
not be able to obtain such financing

    If our business expands rapidly, then a significant strain may be
placed on our resources.  Unless we manage such growth effectively, we may
make mistakes in operating our business such as inaccurate sales forecasting,
incorrect material planning or inaccurate financial reporting, which may
result in unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results.  Our
management team has had limited experience managing rapidly growing companies
on a public or private basis.  We may not be able to install adequate control
systems in an efficient and timely manner, and our current or planned
personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support
our future operations.


The loss of or failure to attract and retain key technical, sales and
marketing and managerial personnel could adversely affect our business

    Our success depends to a significant degree upon the performance and
continued service of engineers involved in the development of our memory and
fibre channel technology and technical support of products and customers.
Our success also depends to a significant degree upon the continued
contributions of our key management, sales and marketing and manufacturing
personnel.  Accordingly, our future success depends upon our ability to
attract, train and retain such technical, sales and marketing and managerial
personnel.  Except for an employment agreement with Joseph F. Kruy, our
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, we do not have employment
agreements with any of these personnel.  We do not maintain key person life
insurance on any of our personnel.  As we further develop our product line we
will need to increase the number of sales and marketing personnel as well as
technical staff members with experience in hardware and software development.
We are currently seeking to hire additional skilled experienced sales
personnel.  Competition for such highly skilled employees in our industry is
intense, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in recruiting or
retaining such personnel.  Our employees may leave and subsequently compete
against us.  The loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect
on our business, operating results or financial condition. We also believe
that our success depends to a significant extent on the ability of our key
personnel to operate effectively, both individually and as a group.


Insiders have and will continue to have substantial control over us and could
delay or prevent a change in our corporate control, which may negatively
affect your investment

    Our officers and directors control the vote of approximately 24.7% of the
outstanding shares of our common stock prior to the exercise of any
outstanding warrants or options or the issuance of shares issuable upon the

3
<PAGE>

conversion of Series A Preferred stock held by them.  Following the issuance
of all shares of our common stock issuable to SovCap Equity Partners, Ltd.
and Arab Commerce Bank Ltd, our officers and directors would continue to
control the vote of approximately 23.2% of the then outstanding shares of
common stock.  As a result, they may be able to significantly influence all
matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of
directors.


Because we rely on a limited number of third party suppliers and
manufacturers, and failures by any of these third parties to provide key
components or to manufacture and assemble products of sufficient quality and
quantity could cause us to delay product shipments, which could result in
delay or lost revenues or customer dissatisfaction

    Advanced Printed Circuit Technology fabricates our printed circuit
boards, and various subcontractors, such as Circuit Technology, Inc., perform
assembly of our memory and host bus adapters boards.  We have no long-term
contracts with Advanced Printed Circuit Technology or Circuit Technology,
Inc. Also, key components that we use in our products may, from time to time,
only be available from single sources with which we do not have long-term
contracts.  In particular, QLogic Corporation is currently the sole supplier
of certain components in certain of our host bus adapters.  The components we
use for our products are based on an emerging technology and may not be
available with the performance characteristics or in the quantities that we
require.  Accordingly, our major suppliers are not obligated to supply
products to us for any specific period, or in any specific quantity, except
as may be provided in a particular purchase order. Moreover, any inability to
supply products due to a lack of components or to redesign products to
incorporate alternative components in a timely manner could materially
adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. If
any of our third-party manufacturers experiences delays, disruptions,
capacity constraints or quality control problems in its manufacturing
operations, then product shipments to our customers could be delayed, which
would negatively impact our net revenues, competitive position and
reputation.

    We have no long-term integrated circuit device supply contracts and are
dependent on a small number of suppliers to supply integrated circuit
devices, which represent approximately 90% of our component costs. Our
dependence on a small number of suppliers and our limited number of long-term
supply contracts expose us to several risks, including the inability to
obtain an adequate supply of components, price increases, late deliveries and
poor component quality.  Micron Semiconductor Electronics and Samsung
Semiconductor currently supply a majority of the DRAM integrated circuit
devices used in our DRAM memory products. A disruption in or termination of
our supply relationship with any of these significant suppliers by natural
disaster or otherwise, or our inability to develop relationships with new
suppliers, if required, would cause delays, disruptions or reductions in
product shipments or require product redesigns which could damage
relationships with our customers, and would increase our costs and/or prices.



Our business would be harmed if we fail to effectively manage the
manufacture of our products.  Because we place orders with our suppliers and
manufacturers based on our forecasts of expected demand for our products, if

4
<PAGE>

we inaccurately forecast demand, we may be unable to obtain adequate
manufacturing capacity or adequate quantities of components to meet our
customers' delivery requirements, or we may accumulate excess inventories.

    We may in the future need to find new suppliers and contract
manufacturers in order to increase our volumes or to reduce our costs.  We
may not be able to find suppliers or contract manufacturers that meet our
needs, and even if we do, qualifying a new contract manufacturer and
commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming.  If we
are required or elect to change suppliers or contract manufacturers, we may
lose revenues, and our customer relationships may suffer.


We may be unable to maintain a steady supply of components

	The electronics industry has experienced in the past, and may
experience in the future, shortages in IC devices, including DRAM, and SRAM
memory. We have experienced and may continue to experience delays in
component deliveries and quality problems, which have caused and could in the
future cause delays in product shipments. In addition, we have required and
could in the future require the redesign of some of our products. In
addition, industry capacity has, from time to time, become constrained such
that some vendors, which supply components for our products have placed their
customers, ourselves included, on allocation. This means that while we may
have customer orders, we may not be able to obtain the materials that we need
to fill those orders in a timely manner.


Our products are complex and may contain undetected hardware, firmware or
software errors or may fail to achieve interoperability standards that could
lead to an increase in our costs, reduce our net revenues, or damage our
reputation

    In order to satisfy our customers, the solutions that we design require
several different products to work together in a seamless fashion.  Our
solutions may fail to achieve various interoperability standards necessary to
satisfy our customers.  Moreover, products as complex as ours frequently
contain undetected hardware, firmware or software errors when first
introduced or as new versions are released.  We have from time to time found
errors in existing products, and we may from time to time find errors in our
existing, new or enhanced products.  Failure to achieve interoperability
among products or the occurrence of hardware, firmware or software errors in
various products could adversely affect sales of our products, cause us to
incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our
engineering personnel from our product development efforts, cause significant
customer relations problems and could result in product returns and loss of
revenue.


Steps taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to
protect our business, and if so, we may be unable to compete effectively

    We primarily rely on unpatented trade secrets to protect our
proprietary rights.  We seek to protect these secrets, in part, through
confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, and our customers and
potential customers.  If these agreements are breached, or if our trade
secrets become known to, or are independently developed by competitors, we

5
<PAGE>

may not have adequate remedies for such breach.  We cannot be certain that
the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will adequately
protect our proprietary rights, that others will not independently develop or
otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or that we can maintain
such technology as trade secrets.  In addition, the laws of some of the
countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold
may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same
extent as the laws of the United States, or at all.  Our failure to protect
our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results or financial condition.


We may become involved in costly and lengthy patent infringement or
intellectual property litigation which could divert management attention,
cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products

    We may receive communications from third parties alleging infringement of
patents or other intellectual property rights, and there is the chance that
third parties may assert infringement claims against us.  Any such claims,
with or without merit, could result in costly and time-consuming litigation
or cause product shipment delays that would adversely affect our business,
financial condition or operating results.  It is possible that holders of
patents or other intellectual property rights may assert rights that apply
broadly to our industry, and that such patent or other intellectual property
rights, if valid, may apply to our products or technology.  These or other
claims may require us to stop using the challenged intellectual property or
to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.  We cannot be certain that the
necessary licenses will be available or that they can be obtained on
commercially reasonable terms.  Our business, operating results or financial
condition could be materially adversely affected if we were to fail to obtain
such royalty or licensing agreements in a timely manner or on reasonable
terms.


Failure to comply with governmental regulations by our OEM customers or us
could reduce our sales or require design modifications

    Our products are subject to U.S. Department of Commerce and Federal
Communications Commission regulations as well as various standards
established by various state, local and foreign authorities.  Failure to
comply with existing or evolving U.S. or foreign governmental regulation or
to obtain timely domestic foreign regulatory approvals or certificates, could
materially harm our business by reducing our sales or requiring design
modifications to our products or the products of OEM customers.  U.S. export
laws also prohibit the export of our products to a number of countries deemed
by the United States to be hostile.  These restrictions may make foreign
competitors facing less stringent controls on their products more competitive
in the global market than we or our customers are.  The U.S. government may
not approve future export license requests.  In addition, the list of
products and countries for which export approval is required, and the
regulatory policies with respect thereto, could be revised.


Our quarterly operating results are volatile and may cause our stock price to
fluctuate and the price of our common stock could fall if quarterly results
are lower than investor expectations and you may lose all or part of your
investment

<PAGE>

    Our revenues and operating results have varied on a quarterly basis in
the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the
future.  The variations in our revenues and operating results are due to a
number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including among
others:

      Changes in our operating expenses;
      Our ability to develop and market new products;
      The ability of our contract manufacturers and suppliers to
      produce and supply our products in a timely manner;
      The market acceptance of our new memory and fibre channel
      products;
      The timing of the introduction or enhancement of products by us,
      OEM and distribution channel customers, and competitors;
      The level of product and price competition;
      Our ability to expand our relationship with OEMs, distribution
      channel and end user customers;
      Activities of and acquisitions by our competitors;
      Changes in technology, industry standards or consumer preferences;
      Changes in the mix of products sold, as our fibre channel
      connectivity products typically have higher margins than our memory and
	disk array products;
      Personnel changes;
      Changes in customer budgeting cycles and the timing of their purchase
      decisions; and
      General economic conditions.

    Accordingly, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of
our operating results as an indication of future performance.  It is possible
that in some future periods our operating results will be below the
expectations of investors.  In this event, the price of our common stock will
likely decline.

    We generally do not have a significant backlog of unfilled orders.  As
a result, our revenues in a given quarter depend substantially on orders
booked in that quarter.  A decrease in the number of orders we receive is
likely to adversely and disproportionately affect our quarterly operating
results.  Our expense levels are partially based on our expectations of
future sales.  Therefore, our expenses may be disproportionately large as
compared to sales in a quarter with reduced orders.  As a result, we may be
unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected
revenue shortfall.  Any shortfall in sales in relation to our quarterly
expectations or any delay of customer orders would likely have an immediate
and adverse impact on our business, quarterly operating results and financial
condition.


                            Risks Related to Our Industry


We are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and
continued deterioration of the current cycle could adversely affect our
business

	The semiconductor industry, including the memory markets in which we
compete, is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid

7
<PAGE>

technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving
standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply
and demand. The industry has experienced significant downturns in the past
and is currently experiencing a significant downturn that may get worse.
Industry downturns are often connected with, or in anticipation of, maturing
product cycles of both semiconductor companies' and their customers' products
and declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been
characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high
inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. The
continuation or worsening of the current downturn in the industry and any
future downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business and
operating results. Furthermore, any upturn in the semiconductor industry
could result in increased demand for, and possible shortages of, components
we use to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits. Such shortages
could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.


Our operating results may suffer because of increasing competition in the
memory and fibre channel connectivity markets

    The market in which we compete is intensely competitive.  As a result,
we face a variety of significant challenges, including rapid technological
advances, price erosion, changing customer preferences and evolving industry
standards.  Our competitors continue to introduce products with improved
price/performance characteristics, and we will have to do the same to remain
competitive.  Increased competition could result in significant price
competition, reduced revenues, lower profit margins or loss of market share,
any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition.  We cannot be certain that we will be able
to compete successfully against either current or potential competitors in
the future.

    Many of our current and potential competitors have substantially
greater financial, technical, marketing and distribution resources than we
have.  We face the threat of potential competition from new entrants into the
memory market, including large technology companies that may develop
or acquire differentiating technology and then apply their resources,
including established distribution channels and brand recognition, to obtain
significant market share.  It is also possible that we will face increased
competition due to mergers or consolidations of existing or potential
competitors.  Emerging companies attempting to obtain a share of the existing
market act as potential competition as well.


We may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position because of
the intense competition in our industry

    We conduct business in an industry characterized by intense competition,
rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, declining average
sales prices and rapid product obsolescence. Our competitors include many
large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater
financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, broader
product lines, lower cost structures, greater brand recognition and longer-
standing relationships with customers and suppliers. As a result, our
competitors are able to respond better to new or emerging technologies or
standards and to changes in customer requirements. Our competitors are able
to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of

8
<PAGE>

products, and may be able to deliver competitive products at a lower price.

    We expect to face competition from existing competitors and new and
emerging companies that may enter our existing or future markets with similar
or alternative products, which may be less costly or provide additional
features. In addition, some of our significant suppliers are also our
competitors, many of whom have the ability to manufacture competitive
products at lower costs as a result of their higher levels of integration. We
also face competition from current and prospective customers that evaluate
our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally.
Competition may arise due to the development of cooperative relationships
among our current and potential competitors or third parties to increase the
ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers.
Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among
competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.

    We expect our competitors will continue to improve the performance of
their current products, reduce their prices and introduce new products that
may offer greater performance and improved pricing, any of which could cause
a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our products. In addition,
our competitors may develop enhancements to or future generations of
competitive products that may render our technology or products obsolete or
uncompetitive.


In our industry, technology and other standards change rapidly, and we may be
unable to keep pace with changes and could hinder our ability to compete
effectively

    The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing
technology, evolving industry standards and the frequent introduction of new
products and enhancements.  If we do not keep pace with these changes, we may
lose market share to our competitors and fail to meet our financial and
operational objectives.  Because many of our products are designed to work
with software produced by third parties, our operating results could be
adversely affected if such third parties delay introduction of new versions
of their software for which we have designed new products or if they make
unanticipated modifications to such software.  Our future success depends in
a large part on our ability to enhance our existing products and to introduce
new products on a timely basis to meet changes in customer preferences and
evolving industry standards.  We cannot be certain that we will be successful
in designing, supplying and marketing new products or product enhancements
that respond to such changes in a timely manner and achieve market
acceptance.  We also cannot be certain that we will be able to develop the
underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and
enhancements, or that we will be able to license the core technologies from
third parties.  Additionally, changes in technology and customer preferences
could potentially render our current products uncompetitive or obsolete.  If
we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop new products or
enhance existing products in a timely manner in response to technological and
market changes, our business, operating results and financial condition would
be materially adversely affected.

                  Risks Related to the Securities Markets

The application of the "penny stock rules" could adversely affect the market
price of our common stock

    On March 24, 2005, the last sales price of our common stock was $0.10.
Because the trading price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share
and our common stock no longer trades on the Nasdaq National Market, our
common stock comes within the definition of a "penny stock."  The "penny
stock rules" impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers
who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and
accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or
annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse).
For transactions covered by these rules, broker-dealers must satisfy certain
additional administrative criteria in order to effectuate sales of our common
stock, including disclosure of the broker-dealer's compensation received for
such transaction, any compensation received by a person associated with the
broker-dealer for this transaction and disclosing certain information to the
investor in writing.  These additional burdens imposed on broker-dealers may
restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect
your ability to resell our common stock.  Among the requirements of
transacting in penny stock is that broker-dealers effecting transactions in
penny stock are required to deliver to the investors, a document containing
specific information about penny stock, and to receive a manually signed and
dated acknowledgement of receipt of such document from investors, prior to
effecting such transactions.  Such requirements may have the effect of making
your investment in our common stock less liquid because the rules will
decrease the number of potential investors and thereby reducing demand for
our stock.


The issuance of shares to SovCap Equity Partners, Arab Commerce Bank, and
others may cause significant dilution in the value of our common stock

    The issuance of shares of our common stock to SovCap Equity Partners and
Arab Commerce Bank will dilute the equity interest of existing stockholders
and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.  As
of December 31, 2004, we had 8,130,702 shares of common stock reserved for
possible future issuances upon, among other things, the conversion of the
series 1 bridge financing note held by Arab Commerce Bank and conversion of
the Series B Preferred shares held by SovCap Equity Partners, the conversion
of Series A Preferred shares, and the exercise of outstanding options and
warrants.

    We may seek additional financing, which would result in the issuance of
additional shares of our capital stock and/or rights to acquire additional
shares of our capital stock.  Additional issuances of capital stock would
result in a reduction of current shareholders' percentage interest in Cambex.
If the exercise price of any outstanding options or warrants is lower than
the price per share of common stock at the time of the exercise, then the
price per share of common stock may decrease because the number of shares of
common stock outstanding would increase without a corresponding increase in
the dollar amount assigned to stockholders' equity.

    The addition of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the
market, including those issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred
shares, or by the registration of any other of our securities under the

10
<PAGE>

Securities Act may significantly and negatively affect the prevailing market
price for our common stock.  Furthermore, future sales of shares of common
stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants may have
a depressive effect on the market price of the common stock, as these
warrants and options would be more likely to be exercised at a time when the
price of the common stock is in excess of the applicable exercise price.


Sales of our common stock in the public market by the selling securityholders
could cause our stock price to decline

    SovCap Equity Partners, Arab Commerce Bank, and Correllus International
hold securities which may be exercisable for and convertible into
approximately 9.1% of our outstanding capital stock at December 31, 2004.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our
stock price to decline.  In addition, the sale of these shares could impair
our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional stock.


Our stock price is volatile and may drop unexpectedly, which could cause you
to lose all or part of your investment

    The stock market in general, and the stock prices of technology-based
companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has
been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company.


Changes in general economic conditions or developments in the data storage,
technology, and personal computer and workstation markets that affect
investor confidence could have a dramatic impact on the market price of our
common stock.  Also, changes in estimates of our earnings as well as any of
the factors described in this "Risk Factors" section could have a significant
impact on the market price of our common stock.  In the past, companies that
have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the
subject of securities class action litigation.  We may be a target of such
litigation in the future.  If we become the subject of securities class
action litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of
management's attention and resources and could seriously harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.


We may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders' equity and
cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities

    We may pursue acquisitions that could provide new technologies or
products.  Future acquisitions may involve the use of significant amounts of
cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity or equity-linked securities,
the incurrence of debt, or amortization expenses related to goodwill and
other intangible assets.

      In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:

         difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies,
         products and personnel of the acquired company;
         the diversion of management's attention from other business
         concerns;
         risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior

11
<PAGE>

         experience; and
         the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company.

    In the event that such an acquisition does occur and we are unable to
successfully integrate businesses, products, technologies or personnel that
we acquire, our business, operating results or financial condition could be
materially adversely affected.


If you invest in our common stock, you should not expect to receive a current
return because we do not pay, and have no foreseeable plans to pay cash
dividends on our common stock

	We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not
anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.  We intend to
retain future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and expansion of our
business and for general corporate purposes.
