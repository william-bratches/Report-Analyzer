LISTING OF DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE:

    year ended December 31,2001

(2) Part III - Items 10-11, 11 and 13 - Definitive proxy statement for the 2002

                               PART I
                               ------

ITEM 1
- ------

Business
- --------
The Registrant's operations are conducted through its Continuous Power Systems
located in Monrovia,California. The products being produced consist of a line of
uninterruptible power supplies (U.P.S) ranging in size from 500VA to 10KVA.
The U.P.S. is a power system that can both smooth out voltage fluctuations
maintain power loan under power blackout conditions. U.P.S.'s are designed to
provide fifteen minutes or more (depending on the number of batteries) of
support power to computers, medical or scientific products, communications
systems, traffic signals or systems, or similar equipment should the utility
power fail. While the utility power is available, the U.P.S. provides isolation
from voltage or frequency transients that may disturb the systems operations.

The Registrant markets the U.P.S. line through trade publications, tradeshows,
web-site and telemarketing. However, Registrant generally makes sales through
distributors who sell the products to end-users. For the year 2001, Nova Power
Systems, a major distributor through its direct and indirect sales, accounted
for approximately, twenty-five percent of the Registrant's total sales.

The Registrant assembles finished components and others materials to power its
products. Relatively little fabrication of raw material is done by the
Registrant. The Registrant purchases raw materials and finished components used
in production of Registrant's products, some of which are imported. Thus, the
Registrant is dependent upon the ability of suppliers to meet performance
specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules.
The Registrant endeavors to assure availability of source of supplies and does
not anticipate any shortages that would adversely affect product schedule.


Competition
- -----------
The markets for the Registrant's products are highly competitive. The registrant
is aware of approximately thirty competitors for online U.P.S. products. Many of
these companies have greater financial resources than the Registrant.
The Registrant competes primarily on the basis of the quality, reliability and
technical sophistication of its products, although price remains an important
factor. The Registrant attempts to locate niche markets for U.P.S. products
where customers require greater reliability.

Substantially, all of the Registrant's products are subject of on-going modifi-
cation and improvement and are subject to scientific and technical changes.


Backlog
- -------
The following table sets forth the amounts representing order the amounts
representing orders believed by the Registrant to be firm. The backlog at
December 31,2001, represents orders that the registrant expects to delivery
during 2002. The only seasonal effects on orders is for the Registrant's
traffic intersections line where the demand is much greater due to power
shortages in many states.
