DESCRIPTION AND LINES OF BUSINESS


Diversified Realty, Inc. (herein referred to as "DRI" or the "Company") is a 
majority-owned subsidiary of M Corp, a financial holding company.  As of 
December 31, 1997, M Corp owned approximately ninety-four percent of the 
outstanding common stock of the Company.

For the past several years, the Company has been primarily engaged in the 
ownership and rental of real property.  As of December 31, 1997, DRI owned 
property in Florida and Montana.

Information as of December 31, 1997, concerning the gross carrying amount of 
real property, accumulated depreciation and encumbrances on a property by 
property basis is presented in Note 6, Investments in Real Estate, of the 
Notes to Financial Statements.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net income increased $34,427 in 1997 from a net loss in 1996 of $6,745 to net
income of $27,682 in 1997. The increase in net income in 1997 as compared 
with 1996 was due in part to an increase in revenues and in part to a 
decrease in expenses.

Rent income decreased $134 (.2%) in 1997 as compared with 1996. Interest 
income increased $16,989 (51.6%) in 1997 as compared with 1996. The increase 
in interest income in 1997 as compared with 1996 was due primarily to an 
increase in interest-bearing deposits.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUED

Operating expenses in total, decreased $23,456 (22.3%) in 1997 as compared 
with 1996. Maintenance expenses decreased $13,046 (28.9%) in 1997 as compared
with 1996 due primarily to decreases in maintenance costs. The provision for 
depreciation decreased $4,621 (24.8%) in 1997 as compared with 1996 due to 
some of the Company's assets being fully depreciated during 1997 and 1996.

Income tax expense increased $10,950 (114.7%) in 1997 as compared with 1996 
due to the increase in pre-tax income. The Company files a consolidated 
income tax return with the Company's parent company and other affiliated 
companies.

Transactions with the Company's parent company and its affiliates during 1997
and 1996 are disclosed in Note 5, Related Party Transactions, of the Notes to
Financial Statements.

The Company is considering acquisitions which would deplete the Company's
available cash and thus affect the liquidity of the Company.

                     	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Nature of Operations, Risks and Uncertainties

The Company is engaged in the ownership and rental of properties located
primarily in Yellowstone County, Montana.

The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of certain types of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled 
transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

(b)	Depreciation

Depreciation for the various classifications of rental property, plant and 
equipment is computed using the straight-line and accelerated methods over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings						                           15 - 27 Years
Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment	         3 - 10 Years

(c)	Income Taxes

The Company files a consolidated income tax return with its parent company.  
Income taxes are allocated to the Company based upon the ratio of the 
Company's pre-tax income to total consolidated pre-tax income.

(d)	Policy of Cash Equivalents

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents include time 
deposits, certificates of deposit and money market accounts, all with original 
maturities of three months or less.

(e) Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts to make 
them comparable to the 1997 presentation. These changes had no	impact on 
previously reported results of operations or shareholders'	equity.

2.CASH BALANCES

The Company maintains cash accounts with various stock brokerage firms.
Cash balances are insured up to $100,000 by the Securities Investor 
Protection Corporation ("SIPC"). At December 31, 1997, a cash balance 
totaling $1,844,048 was uninsured by the SIPC.

3.  CONTRACT RECEIVABLE

The contract receivable at December 31 consists of the following:

                                                   1997              1996    
9% Contract For Deed, due in monthly
 installments of $248 including interest to
 September, 2002                               $  11,466         $   13,317  
 

Less Current Portion                               2,026              1,854  

Long-Term Contract Receivable                  $   9,440          $  11,463  
                                                  
The above contract receivable is secured by real property, the sale of which 
resulted in the receivable. In the event the receivable becomes uncollectible 
and the underlying collateral is completely worthless, the Company would 
incur a loss in the amount of the receivable.

4.	INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense consists of the following, all currently payable:

                                                     1997           1996   

U.S. Income Taxes                                $  17,000      $  (3,200)  

State Income Taxes                                   3,500         12,750  

                                                 $  20,500      $   9,550  


The income tax expense reflected in the financial statements differs from the
amounts that would normally be expected by applying the U.S. Federal income 
tax rates to income before income taxes. The reasons for these differences 
are as follows:

 						                                              1997           1996     

Computed "Expected" Tax Expense                  $  16,400      $     900
State Income Taxes                                   3,500          8,650

                                                 $  20,500      $   9,550

transactions with its parent company or subsidiaries of its parent company, 
as follows:

                                                         1997       1996
