                                     PART I

Item 1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Church Loans & Investments Trust ("the Trust") is a real estate investment trust
organized under the laws of the State of Texas in March 1963. Although the Trust
has the  authority to engage in the  business of buying,  selling and leasing of
real  estate,  the Trust  has  heretofore  restricted  its  business  activities
primarily  to making  loans to churches and other  nonprofit  organizations  and
assisted  living  centers  which are secured by a first  mortgage on real estate
owned by such borrowers.

The period of duration of the Trust, unless dissolved in accordance with law, or
by the consent of the owners of shares of beneficial  interest in the Trust,  is
perpetual.  The Trust may be dissolved by the affirmative  vote of not less than
two-thirds of the owners of outstanding  shares of the Trust.  Owners of Secured
Savings  Certificates,  a debt instrument  issued by the Trust,  have no vote in
regard to any activities of the Trust, including dissolution.

The control and management of the Trust properties,  and all powers necessary or
appropriate  to  effect  any and all of the  purposes  for  which  the  Trust is
organized, is vested in the Board of Trust Managers. All managers are members of
a congregation of the Church of Christ.

The  number of shares of  beneficial  interest  in the Trust  which the Trust is
authorized to issue is unlimited.

The Trust is  qualified  as a "real  estate  investment  trust"  under  Sections
856-858 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the "Internal  Revenue
Code" or "Code").  It is the  intention of the Trust to continue to qualify as a
real estate investment trust under the Code.

The Trust  maintains  an office  located at 5305 I-40 West,  Amarillo,  TX 79106
(telephone 806/358-3666).

As mentioned  above,  the Trust is  primarily  engaged in the business of making
mortgage loans to churches and other nonprofit organizations and assisted living
centers.  The  Declaration  of Trust  restricts the  investments of the Trust to
loans  secured by a first  mortgage,  deed of trust or other lien  covering real
property with the amount of such loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of the value of the
real  property  securing  such loan as  determined  by a  competent  independent
appraiser.  Although  the Trust has been  primarily  in the  business  of making
long-term  mortgage  loans,  during  the past  several  years  it has also  been
actively involved in making short-term  interim or construction loans to finance
the construction of

                                       -4-
<PAGE>

church  buildings,  the purchase of real estate,  or the refinancing of existing
indebtedness. Most, if not all, of the interim loans presently being made by the
Trust are  associated  with  bond  offerings  of  churches  and other  nonprofit
organizations.  These interim loans are scheduled to be repaid from the proceeds
of the bond offerings.

The Trust is not limited to the location of the  property  securing any loans in
which it may invest and seeks to spread its  investments  in areas of the United
States where favorable yields prevail.

As of March 31, 1998, the Trust has 129 permanent and interim mortgage loans and
investments in church bonds having a principal balance of $36,159,738,  with the
average principal amount thereof being $280,308.05.  The interest rates on these
loans vary from 7.5% to 17% per annum with the weighted average interest rate of
mortgage  loans and church bonds being  10.95% per annum at March 31, 1998.  The
original  terms of these  loans  vary  from one year to thirty  years,  with the
majority being for a term of twenty years.

During the fiscal year of the Trust ending March 31, 1998, the net income of the
Trust was  $2,226,533,  as compared to $2,126,758 in fiscal 1997, an increase of
4.69%.  The  increase  in net  income of the Trust was due to  several  factors,
including (a) an increase in net interest  income of the Trust;  (b) an increase
in income  realized  from loan  purchase  discounts;  and (c) an increase in the
average annual interest rate on loans and church bonds held by the Trust.

The net income of the Trust for each of the quarters  during  fiscal 1998 was as
follows:    first    quarter-$471,192;    second   quarter-   $569,632;    third
quarter-$588,876; and fourth quarter-$596,833.

The operational  expense of the Trust increased from $561,527 during fiscal 1997
to  $698,138  in  fiscal  1998.  The  operational  expenses  of the  Trust  were
approximately  17.50% of its gross  income for the year ended  March 31, 1998 as
compared to 14.62% for the year ended March 31, 1997. The operational expense of
the Trust  included  general and  administrative  expenses and  compensation  to
members of the Board of Trust Managers.

During  fiscal 1998,  the Trust  advanced  loan  proceeds of  $23,870,358  on 42
different  loans.  Most,  if not all, of such loans bear  interest at a variable
rate  varying  from 1.5% to 2% per annum in excess of the prime rate of interest
published  by the Wall  Street  Journal  and known as the "Wall  Street  Journal
Prime."

During  fiscal 1998,  the Trust  employed a total of 4 full time  employees  and
employed, as needed, one additional part-time employee.

                                       -5-
<PAGE>

The business  conditions in which the Trust operates has become more competitive
in the past fiscal year as more and more banks are  re-entering  the business of
making loans to churches,  especially  the more  desirable,  less risky,  church
loans.  If this trend  continues,  the rates and fees which the trust can charge
may decrease.  However,  loan demand  remains good as evidenced by the number of
loan  requests  received  by the  Trust  and  the  number  of  loan  commitments
outstanding as of March 31, 1998.

Item 2: DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY

The Trust  maintains as its only place of business  its offices  located at 5305
I-40  West,  in  Amarillo,  Texas.  Such  building  is owned by the Trust and is
occupied  solely by the  Trust.  There is no debt owed by Trust in regard to its
real property.

The real  properties  of the  Trust,  excluding  real  estate  acquired  through
foreclosure,  are not a significant portion of the Trust's assets,  representing
less than 1% of the Trust's total assets.

As previously mentioned,  the Trust's primary business is the making of mortgage
loans to churches and other nonprofit organizations and assisted living centers.
The Declaration of Trust restricts the investments of the Trust to loans secured
by a first  mortgage,  deed of trust,  or other lien covering real property with
the amount of such loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of the value of the real property
securing  such loan.  The  Declaration  of Trust may not be amended  without the
affirmative  vote of  two-thirds  (2/3 rds) of the  Certificates  of  Beneficial
Interest  entitled to vote.  The Board of Trust  Managers'  general policy is to
limit  investment  of Trust  assets  in any one  mortgage  loan to not more than
$2,000,000.  All such investment in mortgage loans is for the purpose of earning
income for the Trust.

Due to several  foreclosures of nonperforming loans, the Trust holds title or an
interest in the title to four  properties  which are  presently  for sale by the
Trust.  These properties are located in San Antonio,  Texas,  Colorado  Springs,
Colorado, Sedona, Arizona and Decatur, Georgia.

Item 5: MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

(a) Market Information

There is no  established  public  trading  market for the  shares of  beneficial
interest of the Trust. During fiscal 1998 a total of 147,328 shares were sold in
the secondary  market at prices ranging from $2.20 to $2.75 per share.  The last
sale  during the fiscal year was at $2.25 per share.  During  fiscal year 1997 a
total of 126,800 shares were sold in the secondary market at prices ranging from

The range of high and low bid information  for shares of beneficial  interest of
the Trust for each quarter within the last two fiscal years is as follows:


                  Quarter           Fiscal 1998   Fiscal 1997
                  -------            High    Low   High   Low

as the Transfer Agent for its own shares.

(b) Holders

Item 6: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--1998 COMPARED TO 1997

During the fiscal year ended  March 31,  1998,  interest  income and fees of the
Trust increased by $147,507 (3.84%) over the previous fiscal year. Such increase
was attributable to several factors,  including (a) a decrease in non-performing
loans; (b) an increase in income realized from loan purchase  discounts;  (c) an
increase in the average  annual  interest rate on loans and church bonds held by
the  Trust;  and (d) an  increase  in the  interest  earned  by the Trust on its
temporary  investments.  The  decrease  in  non-performing  loans  resulted in a
decrease in the interest income that would have been recorded under the original
terms of  nonperforming  loans and church bonds from $389,000 for the year ended
March 31, 1997 to  $339,000  for the year ended  March 31,  1998,  a decrease of
$50,000.  Income from the realization of loan discounts from loan purchases also
increased  from  $166,457  for the year ended March 31, 1997 to $236,512 for the
year ended March 31, 1998, an increase of $70,055.  The average annual  interest
rate on loans and church  bonds held by the Trust  increased  from  10.82% as of
March 31, 1997 to 10.95% as of March 31, 1998.  The increase in interest  income
caused by the increase in the average  annual  interest rate on loans and church
bonds held by the Trust was further stimulated by the net increase in the amount
of total performing  mortgage loans and interim  construction  loans held by the
Trust. Although,  there was a decrease in the amount of performing interim loans
held by the Trust from  $12,133,111  as of March 31, 1997 to  $10,732,915  as of
March 31, 1998,  there was an increase in performing  mortgage  loans during the
recent fiscal year from  $19,177,849  as of March 31, 1997 to  $22,165,629 as of
March 31, 1998. Therefore, the total performing mortgage loans, church bonds and
performing  interim   construction  loans  held  by  the  Trust  increased  from
$31,310,960  as of March 31, 1997 to $32,898,544 as of March 31, 1998. The Trust
also  experienced  an increase in its interest  earned on temporary  investments
from $52,595 as of March 31, 1997 to $62,705 as of March 31,  1998,  an increase
of 19.22%.

In fiscal  1998,  the average  aggregate  amount of total debt  outstanding  was
$274,559 less than in fiscal 1997.  Furthermore,  interest expense  decreased by
$15,623. Such decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the debt of the Trust.
Such  decrease was somewhat  offset by an increase in the Trust's cost of funds.
The  approximate  weighted  average  annual  interest  rate  upon the  aggregate
outstanding  debt increased from 7.12% during fiscal 1997 to 7.26% during fiscal
1998.

The net  income of the  Trust  for 1998 was  $2,226,533  ($.32  per  share),  an
increase of $99,775  (4.69%) from the previous  fiscal year.  Such  increase was
primarily  attributable  to an increase in net interest income in fiscal 1998 as
compared  to fiscal  1997 as  discussed  above.  Dividends  related to 1998 were
$2,242,369 or $.32

                                       -8-
<PAGE>

per share.  Dividends  are based on taxable  income which varies from net income
reported  in  the  financial   statements   because  of  temporary   differences
(differences  between the tax basis of an asset or  liability  and its  reported
amount in the  financial  statements  that will result in taxable or  deductible
amounts in future years).  Future dividends may be less than net income reported
in the financial statements because of variances in these temporary differences.

During fiscal 1998,  the prime  interest rate remained at 8.50%  throughout  the
year.  Should the prime interest rate decrease  during fiscal 1999, the interest
expense of the Trust  will  generally  decrease  and the net income of the Trust
will in turn generally increase.  Should the prime interest rate increase during
fiscal 1999, the interest  expense of the Trust will generally  increase and the
net income of the Trust will in turn generally decrease.

Payments  received on the interim and  permanent  loan  portfolio and the church
bonds  held by the  Trust  increased  from  $14,921,586  during  fiscal  1997 to
$31,194,006  during  fiscal  1998,  an increase of 109.05%.  This  increase  was
attributable  to: (a) an increase in interim  loans made by the Trust during the
year ended  March 31,  1998;  and (b) the  pay-off  prior to maturity of several
significant mortgage loans.

During fiscal 1998, the Trust foreclosed on three nonperforming loans with total
principal   balances  of   approximately   $1,360,000.   One  loan   constituted
approximately $976,000 of the total and was secured by an assisted living center
located in Sedona,  Arizona. The Trust leased this property to a third party and
recognized  approximately  $77,000  in  other  income  from the  rental  of such
property.  The recorded loan balance of all these loans  approximated fair value
of the properties securing such loans. Presently,  the Trust is actively seeking
disposition of the properties.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Trust is engaged  primarily in the business of making  permanent and interim
loans to churches and other  non-profit  organizations,  and to other borrowers,
including  businesses  engaged in the building and operation of assisted  living
centers.  At March 31, 1998, the Trust had five loans to assisted living centers
which totaled approximately $8,063,000.  Three of these loans were to affiliated
borrowers totaling  approximately  $7,230,000.  In addition,  the Trust had four
loan  commitments  outstanding  as of March 31,  1998 for the  construction  and
financing  of  assisted  living  centers  in the  total  approximate  amount  of
$7,845,000.  The assets of the Trust primarily consist of its loan portfolio and
its office building and facilities. The operational expense of the

                                       -9-

Trust is comprised of the maintenance of its office building, the payment of the
salaries  of its  management  and  clerical  staff and the payment for legal and
accounting  services.  Substantially all of the Trust assets are invested in the
permanent  and interim  loans made by the Trust.  The only  potential  liquidity
problems  of the Trust are  related to the timely  and proper  repayment  by the
Trust of the  leveraged  funds it has  borrowed  to make  loans in excess of its
capital and the ability to fund loan commitments  which totalled  $14,275,000 at
March 31, 1998. All of the indebtedness of the Trust is generally  classified as
short term having  maturities  ranging from "on demand" to maturities  repayable
over various periods extending through 2000.

The annual  maturities upon all debt obligations of the Trust  outstanding as of
March  31,  1998  for  the  next  three  fiscal  years  are:   1999-$11,360,157;
2000--$2,085,377;  and 2001-$1,329,000. These debt obligations primarily consist
of the Trust's bank line of credit,  Master Note  Agreements and Secured Savings
Certificates  ("Certificates")  which have been previously  issued by the Trust.
Certificates  outstanding  as of March 31, 1998 that will mature during the next
three fiscal years are: 1999--$3,649,446; 2000- $2,085,377; and 2001-$1,329,000.

At March 31, 1998 loans to the Trust under Master Note  Agreements  which are in
effect demand notes total  $4,910,711.  In the past,  the Trust has utilized its
bank line of  credit,  principal  paid to the Trust  upon its  outstanding  loan
portfolio,  and the proceeds  received from the sale of Certificates in order to
meet its maturing obligations.

At March 31,  1998,  the  balance  which could be borrowed by the Trust upon its
bank line of credit was  $12,200,000.  The  principal  payments  scheduled to be
received by the Trust upon its loan  portfolio  for the years  ending  March 31,
1999, 2000 and 2001 are $13,630,826,  $1,655,727, and $1,574,204,  respectively.
Assuming all of these scheduled principal payments are received, these payments,
together with the balance  available to Church Loans on its bank line of credit,
would  allow  Church  Loans  to  have  sufficient  funds  to meet  its  maturing
obligation  and fund loan  commitments  without the  necessity  for Church Loans
having to sell any additional Certificates or borrow funds from other sources.

During fiscal 1998 and 1997 the Trust sold Certificates in the principal amounts
of $3,314,121 and $2,648,579,  respectively. Due to the cost of registration and
of sales of such Certificates,  the cost of these funds are normally higher than
the cost of borrowing  from bank sources or master notes.  Therefore,  the Trust
discontinued   the   registration  of  Certificates  and  ceased  the  sales  of
Certificates  as of July 16,  1997.  The Trust also  obtained an increase in its
bank line of credit from $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 effective September 1, 1997.
Based upon the success of the Trust to obtain  borrowings in the past, the Trust
is confident that,

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

should it be  necessary,  it will be able to register and sell  Certificates  or
obtain  additional  bank  financing in the future in sufficient  amounts for the
Trust to timely meet all of its obligations.

Should all the scheduled  principal payments upon loans made by the Trust not be
received,  and should the Trust be unable to borrow  against its line of credit,
and should  borrowings from other sources not be available it would be necessary
for the Trust to sell a portion of its mortgage  loan  portfolio in order for it
to meet all of its  financial  obligations.  At March 31,  1998,  the  principal
balance of the loan and church bond portfolio of the Trust was $35,390,639.  The
weighted  average  interest rate on loans and church bonds was 10.95% per annum.
In view of the normal  marketability  of  conventional  loans,  the Trust  would
probably be required to discount the great  majority of these loans in order for
them to be  attractive  for  purchase.  The  principal  amount of these loans if
discounted to yield a weighted  average  interest rate of 12%, 14% and 16% would
be  $32,293,958,  $27,680,536,  and  $24,220,469,   respectively.  There  is  no
assurance  that the  Trust  would be able to sell  all,  or a  portion  of,  its
portfolio  of loans,  in which  event,  it would be  necessary  for the Trust to
secure a loan,  or  loans,  from a lender  in  order  for the  Trust to meet its
financial  obligations.  There is no  assurance  that the Trust would be able to
secure a loan in such instance.  The Trust has sold only one of the loans in its
mortgage loan portfolio and therefore has limited experience in this area.

Principal payments scheduled to be received by the Trust upon its permanent loan
portfolio  during the years ending March 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, if not used to
fund new loan commitments,  would be used to reduce the outstanding indebtedness
of the Trust.  Should the Trust use the  payments  of  principal  which shall be
received upon its loan  portfolio to reduce its  outstanding  indebtedness,  the
interest  expense of the Trust will  decrease.  In such  instance,  whether  the
decrease in the interest  income will exceed,  or be less than,  the decrease in
the interest  expense will largely be dependent  upon the prime rate of interest
prevailing  at such time due to the fact that the  interest  to be earned by the
Trust upon its mortgage loan  portfolio is generally  based upon a fixed rate of
interest or a variable rate of interest that  periodically  reprices,  while the
interest  to be paid by the Trust upon its  outstanding  debts is  directly,  or
indirectly, tied to the prime rate of interest charged by major domestic banks.

As of March 31, 1998, a substantial  portion of the promissory  notes evidencing
the  loans  made by the Trust  have  been  pledged  to  secure  its  outstanding
indebtedness.  At March 31, 1998  promissory  notes in the  principal  amount of
$7,085,080  had been pledged to secure  Certificates  which had been  previously
sold by the Trust. The required  collateral for these Certificates (based on the
ratio of 1.0 to 1 for Certificates in Series O) was $7,063,823, leaving an

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

excess of  promissory  notes which have been pledged by the Trust to secure said
Certificates of $21,257.  Additionally,  promissory  notes totalling  $5,025,556
were  pledged  against  the bank  line of credit  which had a total  outstanding
balance  of  $2,800,000.   The  required  collateral  for  this  bank  loan  was
$3,080,000,  leaving an excess of  promissory  notes which have been  pledged to
secure  said bank notes of  $1,945,556.  These  excess  promissory  notes may be
reassigned by the Indenture Trustee or bank to the Trust to be sold in order for
the Trust to meet its financial obligations. Should it be necessary in order for
the Trust to meet its  financial  obligations,  these excess notes  amounting to
$1,966,813 and other additional  promissory  notes in the approximate  amount of
$23,280,003 (for a total amount of $25,246,816) would be available to be sold by
the Trust to meet its financial obligations.  Should the excess promissory notes
be  assigned  by the  Indenture  Trustee  or bank  to the  Trust  as  heretofore
described,  all outstanding  Certificates sold by the Trust and the bank line of
credit would  continue to be secured by the required  ratio of notes  pledged to
the principal balance of these  Certificates and the bank line of credit.  There
is no  assurance  that the Trust  would be able to sell all,  or any  portion of
these notes.

Cash flows from  operating  activities  consists  primarily  of net income.  The
primary  components  of net income are  interest  income and  expense.  Interest
income  should  continue  to be the main source of cash  provided  by  operating
activities;  however,  the  availability of this cash flow is dependent upon the
ability of the  borrowers to repay loans.  Although  there was a decrease in the
amount of non-performing  loans as of March 31, 1998 compared to March 31, 1997,
management  does not  expect  material  changes  in such loans in the near term.
Accordingly,  cash provided by operating  activities has been and is expected to
be a relatively stable source of cash flow.

Cash flows from investing  activities  results  primarily from investment in and
payments received on mortgage and interim construction loans and church bonds.

Cash flows  from  financing  activities  relate  primarily  to the  payments  on
Certificates  and  borrowings  and  payments  on notes  payable  and the line of
credit.  Borrowings  are made as funds are  needed to make  loans or as  current
obligations become due. Based upon the success of the Trust to obtain borrowings
in the past, the Trust is confident that it will be able to obtain borrowings in
the future in sufficient  amounts,  along with payments to be received on loans,
to timely meet its obligations.  Furthermore,  the Trust is confident that if it
decides to register additional  Certificates in the future it would have similar
success in selling the Certificates as it has had in the past.

INFLATION

At March 31, 1998, the weighted  average  interest rate on the mortgage loan and
church  bond  portfolio  of the Trust was  10.95% per annum  while the  weighted
average  interest  rate upon all  borrowings  of the Trust was 7.44% per  annum.
Although a majority of the loans  constituting  the loan  portfolio of the Trust
have been made at  variable  rates of interest  that  generally  reprice  either
daily, annually, or otherwise periodically,  a portion of the loans constituting
the  Trust's  loan  portfolio  have been  made at fixed  rates of  interest  and
therefore are not subject to being increased or decreased during the term of the
loan.  All  of  the   indebtedness  of  the  Trust,   other  than  the  existing
Certificates,  is  either  directly  or  indirectly  tied to the  prime  rate of
interest  charged by major  banking  institutions  and  therefore  is subject to
fluctuation.  During periods of inflation, the prime rate of interest charged by
major  banking  institutions,  as well as the interest rate or cost of borrowing
money from any lender, generally increases. Consequently, during an inflationary
period the  interest  expense of the Trust would  increase.  Since the  interest
income of the Trust would not  increase as rapidly,  an increase in the interest
expense  of the Trust  would  decrease  the net  income of the  Trust.  However,
interest  income should  subsequently  increase as variable rate loans  reprice.
Should the amount of the loans and the amount of the  indebtedness  of the Trust
remain  constant,  and  should  the  weighted  average  interest  rate  upon the
indebtedness increase to approximately 27.00% per annum, the interest income and
the interest expense of the Trust would be substantially equal.

YEAR 2000 ISSUES

The Trust is in the process of addressing the possible  exposures related to the
impact of the Year 2000. Management does not believe that the cost of making the
Trust's  hardware  and  software  Year 2000  compliant  will be  material to the
Trust's financial condition in any single year.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Trust Managers and Shareholders
Church Loans & Investments Trust
Amarillo, Texas

We have audited the  accompanying  balance  sheets of Church Loans & Investments
Trust (a real estate  investment  trust) as of March 31, 1998 and 1997,  and the
related statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the years
then ended.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the  financial  position of Church Loans &  Investments
Trust as of March 31, 1998 and 1997,  and the results of its  operations and its
cash  flows for the years  then  ended in  conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles.

                   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

                             MARCH 31, 1998 AND 1997

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Church Loans &  Investments  Trust  (Church  Loans) is a real estate  investment
trust that  invests  primarily  in mortgage  and interim  construction  loans to
churches and other borrowers (see note 1) across the United States, particularly
in the  southern  portion of the U.S.  Church  Loans  requires  that real estate
properties  be pledged  against  loans as security  which could be foreclosed by
Church  Loans  should  the  borrower  default.   Repayment  of  each  borrower's
obligations is generally  expected to be repaid from  contributions  from church
members  or  from  operations  of  the  borrower,  or in  the  case  of  interim
construction loans, by permanent financing provided by others.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting  period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CURRENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

Church Loans has historically invested in long-term,  fixed-rate mortgage loans,
generally funded by relatively  short-term secured savings  certificates  (SSCs)
and debt obligations. The volatility of interest rates and increased competition
to attract  customers'  funds have caused Church Loans'  liability  structure to
become short-term and rate sensitive. Church Loans reflected an average interest
yield on its loan and church bond  portfolio,  an average  interest  rate on its
total  indebtedness and a net interest rate margin at March 31, 1998 and 1997 as
follows:

                                   LOAN AND CHURCH      TOTAL       NET INTEREST
                                   BOND PORTFOLIO    INDEBTEDNESS   RATE MARGIN
                                   --------------    ------------   -----------
March 31, 1998 ....................    10.95%            7.44%          3.51%
March 31, 1997 ....................    10.82%            7.36%          3.46%

Church  Loans  finances  maturities  of SSCs and debt  obligations  through  its
available  lines of credit and principal  payments  received on its mortgage and
interim construction loans.

CHURCH BONDS

Church bonds,  secured by first mortgage liens on church facilities,  are stated
at cost,  as there is no traded market for the bonds and  management  intends to
hold such securities until maturity.

                   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

                             MARCH 31, 1998 AND 1997

LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR POSSIBLE CREDIT LOSSES

Loans are  stated at the  amount of unpaid  principal,  reduced  by  unamortized
purchase discounts and the allowance for possible credit losses. Interest income
is recognized when earned.

Impaired loans are measured  based on the present value of expected  future cash
flows  discounted at the loan's  effective  interest rate or the market price or
the  fair  value of the  collateral  if the loan is  collateral  dependent.  The
accrual of interest is  generally  discontinued  on loans and church  bonds more
than 90 days past due or when there is sufficient  doubt as to the collection of
interest. When interest accrual is discontinued,  all unpaid accrued interest is
reversed.  Cash  interest  payments  received  are  applied  to  principal  when
collection of principal is in doubt or are  recognized  as interest  income when
recovery of principal is reasonably assured.

The allowance for possible credit losses is established  through a provision for
possible  credit losses  charged to expense.  Loans and church bonds are charged
against  the  allowance  when  collectibility  of  the  principal  is  unlikely.
Recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance.  The
charge  to  operations  is based on  management's  and the  board of  directors'
evaluation of the loan and church bond portfolio,  including such factors as the
security  collateralizing the loans or church bonds, past credit loss experience
and general economic  conditions.  The allowance is subjective in nature and may
be  adjusted  in the near term  because of changes in the  borrower's  financial
status or economic conditions.

Loan  origination fees are collected only on a few permanent loans and generally
recognized as income when received and the associated loan origination costs are
expensed when incurred.  The effect on the accompanying  financial statements is
not materially  different from generally  accepted  accounting  principles which
require that loan fees, net of origination costs, be deferred and amortized into
interest income over the life of the related loan.

Commitment fees received on interim  construction  loans are recognized over the
interim commitment period for loans that are not permanently  financed by Church
Loans  and over the life of the  mortgage  loan for loans  that are  permanently
financed by Church Loans.  Amounts are being amortized  using the  straight-line
method.  This method was not  materially  different from the method of deferring
commitment fees until the commitment is exercised and  recognizing  such fees as
an adjustment to yield by the interest  method over the related  loans' lives as
prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles for the years ended March
31, 1998 and 1997.

Purchase discounts on loans are amortized based on the interest method.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property  and  equipment  are  stated at cost,  less  accumulated  depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on the  straight-line  method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 18 years.

REAL ESTATE ACQUIRED THROUGH FORECLOSURE

Real estate acquired through,  or in lieu of, loan foreclosure is to be sold and
is  initially   recorded  at  estimated   fair  value  at  date  of  foreclosure
establishing a new cost basis. Other real estate owned,  after  foreclosure,  is
carried at the lower of carrying  amount or the property's  estimated fair value
minus estimated costs to sell (fair value). Declines in the estimated fair value
below cost are recognized as a valuation allowance.  If the estimated fair value
subsequently  increases  above its carrying  value,  the valuation

                             MARCH 31, 1998 AND 1997

allowance  is  reduced,  but not  below  zero.  Increases  or  decreases  in the
valuation allowance are charged or credited to operations.

The  valuation  of other real estate  owned is  subjective  in nature and may be
adjusted  in the near term  because of changes in economic  conditions  or other
factors.

UNAMORTIZED DEBT EXPENSE

Commissions paid to brokers in connection with the sale of SSCs are deferred and
amortized  over the terms of the related  certificates  on the interest  method.
Costs  incurred in  connection  with the  registration  of SSCs are deferred and
amortized on the straight-line  method over the period the related  certificates
are sold,  but no longer than two years from the date the  registration  becomes
effective.

INCOME TAXES

Income taxes are accounted for under  Statement No. 109,  ACCOUNTING  FOR INCOME
TAXES.  Under the asset and  liability  method of  Statement  109,  deferred tax
assets  and  liabilities   are  recognized  for  the  future  tax   consequences
attributable to differences  between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing  assets and liabilities  and their  respective tax bases.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled.  Under Statement 109, the effect on deferred tax assets
and  liabilities  of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In  the   ordinary   course  of   business,   Church   loans  has  entered  into
off-balance-sheet  financial  instruments  consisting of  commitments  to extend
credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when
they become payable.

CASH FLOWS

For  purposes  of  reporting  cash  flows,  cash  and cash  equivalents  include
cash-on-hand  and investment in a money market mutual fund and  certificates  of
deposit with maturities of less than 90 days at the time of acquisition.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain amounts in the 1997 balance sheet have been reclassified to conform with
the 1998 presentation.

                  This information is an integral part of the
                       accompanying financial statements.

NOTE 1 - LOANS AND CHURCH BONDS

Mortgage loans  receivable  consist of  conventional  loans of  $23,974,905  and
$20,600,313  and church  bonds of  $488,839  and  $520,894 at March 31, 1998 and
1997, respectively. Interim construction loans of $11,695,994 and $14,327,500 at
March 31, 1998 and 1997,  respectively,  consist  primarily of loans to churches
for the construction of church facilities and assisted living centers.  Mortgage
loans,  church bonds and interim  construction  loans are  generally  secured by
first liens on real estate  comprised  primarily of church  buildings  and other
real  estate.  The  amount of a loan is  generally  limited  to  66-2/3%  of the
appraised  value of the  related  property.  Certain  loans  are  guaranteed  by
individual  members of the  congregations or other individuals or congregations,
depending on the circumstances.

Church  Loans'  portfolio  included  mortgage  loans,  church  bonds and interim
construction loans with interest rates ranging from 7.75% to 17.00% at March 31,
1998.  The weighted  average  annual  interest  rates of Church  Loans' loan and
church  bond  portfolio  were  10.95%  and  10.82% at March  31,  1998 and 1997,
respectively.

Generally accepted accounting principles require disclosure of information about
certain current vulnerabilities due to certain concentrations.  In addition to a
concentration  of loans to  churches,  Church Loans makes  certain  interim real
estate  construction  loans and permanent loans to entities other than churches.
At March 31,  1998,  Church  Loans had five  loans  secured by  assisted  living
centers which  totaled  approximately  $8,063,000.  Three of these loans were to
affiliated  borrowers  totaling  approximately  $7,230,000 at March 31, 1998. In
addition,  Church Loans had four loan  commitments at March 31, 1998 for interim
construction  and permanent  financing of assisted  living centers which totaled
approximately $7,845,000.

church bonds amounted to approximately $339,000 and $389,000 for the years ended
March 31,  1998 and 1997,  respectively.  Interest  income  actually  recognized
during 1998 was approximately  $111,000.  Interest income actually recognized in
1997 was not significant.

In addition to the aforementioned loans, management has doubts about the ability
of a borrower for a $1,300,000 loan to comply with its present  repayment terms.
This loan was not included as nonperforming at March 31, 1998.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                             MARCH 31, 1998 AND 1997

Descriptions of the various categories of debt obligations follow:

SECURED SAVINGS CERTIFICATES

SSCs were  issued in amounts of $1,000 or more and have  single  maturity  dates
from 30 days to 10 years  from  date of issue.  With  respect  to an  individual
certificate, interest rate and frequency of payment of interest (either monthly,
quarterly,  semiannually,  annually  or at  maturity)  are  fixed at the time of
issuance of the certificate.  Effective July 1997, Church Loans discontinued the
sale of SSCs.

The certificates are secured under the terms of certain indentures that require,
among other things,  the pledge of mortgage notes  receivable  with total unpaid
principal  amounts  not less  than  100% of the  aggregate  principal  amount of
certain respective SSC registrations outstanding. As of March 31, 1998 and 1997,
Church Loans was in compliance with the requirement.

LINE OF CREDIT PAYABLE TO BANK

The line of credit payable to bank consists of borrowings under a loan agreement
effective   through   September  1,  1998,   that  provides  for  a  $15,000,000
($10,000,000  in 1997) line of credit with  certain  commitment  fees.  The loan
agreement  requires  Church Loans to pledge  mortgage  loans  receivable  having
unpaid principal balances with an aggregate present value, discounted at 2% over
the  prime  rate  (10.50%  at March  31,  1998),  of not less  than  110% of all
indebtedness  owed to the bank.  Interest  accrued  at the  prime  rate less one
percent from  September  1, 1997 to March 31,  1998,  at the prime rate less one
quarter of one  percent  from  September  1, 1996 to August 31,  1997 and at the
prime  rate  from  April  1,  1996 to  August  31,  1996.  Interest  is  payable
semiannually.

Additionally,  the line of credit  requires  that Church  Loans' net worth be no
less than  $18,000,000 and its total  indebtedness  shall not exceed 150% of its
net worth. At March 31, 1998, Church Loans' total indebtedness was approximately
$17,200,000 less than the maximum amount permitted under the agreement.

DEMAND NOTES PAYABLE

The demand notes  payable bear  interest at 1% less than the prime rate (payable
monthly) and are unsecured (see note 6).

NOTE 3 - INCOME TAX PROVISION

Church Loans has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a real estate  investment
trust under the Code, Church Loans must, among other things, distribute at least
95% of its taxable income to its shareholders through dividends. Church Loans is
required to pay  dividends  of at least 85% of its calendar  year  undistributed
income by February 1 or be subject to a special  federal excise tax of 4% on the
undistributed amount.

Deferred  taxes were not  significant  to Church Loans' 1998 and 1997  financial
statements.

NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS

Church Loans is a party to financial instruments with  off-balance-sheet risk in
the normal course of business.  Commitments  to extend credit are  agreements to
lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established
in the contract.  Commitments  generally  have variable  interest  rates,  fixed
expiration  dates or other  termination  clauses and  require  payment of a fee.
Since some of the  commitments  may expire  without being drawn upon,  the total
commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Church
Loans  evaluates each  customer's  credit  worthiness on a  case-by-case  basis.
Collateral  generally  includes real estate  properties.  The exposure to credit
loss in the event of  nonperformance  by the other party to the  commitments  to
extend  credit is  represented  by the  contractual  amount.  At March 31, 1998,
Church  Loans  had  outstanding  loan  commitments  (by  contract   amounts)  of
approximately  $14,275,000,  including $7,845,000 to finance the construction of
or provide permanent financing for assisted living centers.  Management does not
anticipate any losses as a result of these transactions.

NOTE 9 -      DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial  instruments,  the results of applying  such methods and
assumptions to the financial  instruments and limitations inherent in fair value
estimates:

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The assets are considered  short-term  instruments for which the carrying amount
is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                             MARCH 31, 1998 AND 1997

LOANS AND CHURCH BONDS

Fair  values  are  estimated  for  portfolios  of loans with  similar  financial
characteristics.  Loans are  segregated  by type,  such as mortgage  and interim
construction  loans and church bonds.  Each loan  category is further  segmented
into  fixed  and  adjustable  rate  interest  terms.  For  variable-rate  loans,
primarily  interim  construction  loans,  that  reprice  frequently  and with no
significant  change in credit risk,  fair values are based on carrying  amounts.
The fair value of fixed-rate  mortgage loans and bonds is generally estimated by
discounting  the future cash flows  through  the  estimated  maturity  using the
current  rates at which  similar  loans would be made to borrowers  with similar
credit  ratings.  The estimate of maturity is based on Church Loans'  historical
experience with repayments for each loan classification,  modified, as required,
by an estimate of the effect of current  economic  and lending  conditions.  The
carrying  value of loans,  net of the allowance for loan losses was  $34,355,426
and  $33,614,231 and the fair value of loans was  approximately  $34,800,000 and
$33,900,000 at March 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

NOTES PAYABLE AND LINE OF CREDIT

The fair value of notes payable and the line of credit are equal to the carrying
value as such liabilities are deemed to be short-term borrowings.

SECURED SAVINGS CERTIFICATES

The fair value of secured  savings  certificates  is  estimated  using the rates
currently  offered for financial  instruments  of similar  characteristics.  The
carrying value of secured savings certificates was $7,063,823 and $7,573,972 and
the fair value of secured savings certificates was approximately  $7,200,000 and
$7,600,000 at March 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

Generally,  Church Loans enters into  commitments to extend credit at adjustable
interest terms.  Accordingly,  the commitment amount is a reasonable estimate of
fair value.

LIMITATIONS

Fair value  estimates  are made at a specific  point in time,  based on relevant
market  information  and  information  about  the  financial  instrument.  These
estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering
for sale at one time Church  Loans'  entire  holdings of a particular  financial
instrument.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of Church Loans'
financial  instruments,  fair value  estimates are based on judgments  regarding
future   expected   loss   experience,   current   economic   conditions,   risk
characteristics  of various  financial  instruments,  and other  factors.  These
estimates  are  subjective  in nature and involve  uncertainties  and matters of
significant  judgment  and,  therefore,  cannot be  determined  with  precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

                      This information is an integral part
                    of the accompanying financial statements.
