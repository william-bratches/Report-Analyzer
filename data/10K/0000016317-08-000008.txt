PART 1

ITEM 1.  Business

Registrant was incorporated under the laws of the State of California
on July 12, 1922, under the name of California Copper Corporation,
as a holding company for the shares of its operating company, Engels
Copper Mining Company which was incorporated under the laws of the
State of California on June 19, 1901.  Engels Copper Mining Company
was merged into California Copper Corporation on March 3, 1936, and
the name of the merged company was changed to California-Engels
Mining Company.  Exploration and development commenced at the Engels
Mine, Lights Creek Mining District, Plumas County, California, upon
organization of Engels Copper Mining Company; but it was not until 1914
when the first all flotation mill for copper in the United States was built
and actual production of copper started.  From 1914 until operations
were suspended due to the low price of copper in July, 1930, approximately
4,700,000 tons of ore were mined from the Engels and Superior mines and
milled producing 160,170,000 pounds of copper and substantial values
in gold and silver. Out of profits of this operation, the Registrant retired
a bond issue of $500,000 and paid out more than $1,285,000 in dividends.
During the 1930's the mining and milling plant, Engelmine town site and
the Indian Valley Railroad subsidiary were dismantled and sold.

Registrant's mining properties were continuously leased from September, 1947,
to March, 1951; from March, 1951, to December, 1959; from November, 1960,
to October, 1979; from August, 1980, to August, 1990; and from November, 1990,
to April 1993.  The lessee from 1964 to 1993 was Placer Dome U.S. Inc., the U.S.
subsidiary of Placer Dome Inc., Vancouver, B.C., Canada.  The Mining Lease With
Option to Purchase, between the Registrant (Lessor) and Placer Dome U.S. Inc.
(Lessee) was terminated by Placer Dome U.S. Inc. effective April 20, 1993.
Registrant received a substantial amount of technical data on its mining
properties and maintains a library on the Plumas Copper Belt.

During the 1960's and 1970s Placer Dome U.S. Inc. conducted an exploration
and development program on Registrant's Superior Mine, Sulphide Ridge property
and Engels Mine. They identified two large porphyry-type copper bearing zones
in the Superior Mine and on Sulphide Ridge. The Engels Mine was also estimated
to contain copper mineralization amenable to bulk mining method. Both the
Engels and Superior mines contain high-grade surface and underground copper
mineralization. Other exploration targets remain to be tested including an
intensely sheared area in the quartz monzonite southeast of the Superior
Mine and north of Superior Ridge, the Quigley Prospect, the area between the
Superior and  Engels mines in the quartz monzonite near its contact with the
coarse grained granite, along the main fault zone and the metavolcanic, quartz
diorite, gabbro contact northeast of the Engels Mine and an indicated quartz
monzonite intrusive beneath the Engels Mine where a deep ore system could be
found.These deposits and prospects were not deemed economically attractive
for many years. However in response to a projected global shortage of copper
and higher prices, interest renewed in the geologically unique Lights Creek
Mining District.


On April 18, 2006, Registrant entered into an Exploration Permit With Option
to Lease and Purchase agreement with American Sheffield Inc., a Nevada
corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sheffield Resources Ltd., a British
Columbia corporation, on its 36 patented lode mining claims and 162.12 acres of
fee lands at Engelmine, Lights Creek Mining District, Plumas County,
California. Subsequently on August 10, 2006, American Sheffield Inc.
excercised its option to enter into the Lease and Purchase agreement.
The Lease and Purchase agreement call for annual payments of $20,000 and
the issuance of up to 250,000 shares of Sheffield Resources Ltd. Other
clauses customary to mining leases are included in the agreement. To exercise
its option to purchase the above Registrants property, American Sheffield Inc.
may pay either 1,000,000 shares of Sheffield Resources Ltd. or $10,000,000.
Registrant to receive an annual advance royalty payment of $60,000 subject to
CPI adjustments or two percent (2%) of Net Smelter Returns, which ever is
greater. Net Smelter Return royalties are capped at $25,000,000. Registrant
retains the right to the timber on its above property and to manage its
Engelmine Forest, California Tree Farm # 2611 pursuant to its Non-Industrial
Timber Management Plan and to extract road rock from the No. 10 Level dump of
the Engels Mine.  After mining and reclamation has been completed on the above
property Registrant may request to have title to the lands transferred back
to Registrant.

During 2007, American Sheffield Inc., drilled a total of 2,322.7m in 32 HQ
drill holes and took 250.3m long channel samples from surface trenches at the
Engels Mine  prospect. In addition the Number 3 Level of the Engels Mine was
reopened and the accessible portion was continuously channel sampled. Drilling
will resume in the spring of 2008 to further define the Engels Mine high-grade
mineralization. The drill program is designed to define high-grade copper
mineralization which may be mined in a pit of a copper leach mine.

A Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan on Registrants mining properties
was approved by the California Department of Forestry and became effective
July 2, 1999.  The permitting process for this project began in August, 1994
with the start of the archaeological survey and the February, 1995 agreement
with Shasta Land Management Consultants to prepare the Plan.

Registrant made application to the California Tree Farm Committee of the
American Tree Farm System for approval of its Engelmine Forest timber lands
on Lights Creek as a tree farm.  Its Engelmine Forest was accepted as
California Tree Farm No. 2611 on June 17, 1999.

From 1999 to 2001 Registrant engaged in mechanical thinning and timber harvest
projects on its properties producing 1,809,520 board feet of timber. Hand
thinning projects were ongoing on overstock areas of Registrants property.
The purpose of thinning harvests was to reduce fire danger, improve the
timber stand, provide wildlife protection, remove hazard timber and
improve aesthetics.

The U.S.D.A. Forest Service approved its Sierra Nevada Forest Plan
Amendment on January 21, 2004 and affirmed it after appeals on
November 18, 2004. The plan was to activate the Herger-Feinstein
Quincy Library Group (HFQLG) pilot project on the Plumas National
Forest. If the Diamond Vegetation Management Project of the HFQLG
had been implemented it would have resulted in surface ladder fuels
thinning to reduce the extent and severity of wildland fire on the
Plumas National Forest surrounding Registrants property. The project was
blocked upon appeal by various environmental groups. Registrants Engelmine
Forest tree farm was severely damaged by the 65,000 acre Moonlight Fire on
the Plumas National Forest between September 3-15, 2007. Mineral lessee,
American Sheffield Inc. contractors drill rig, water truck and trailer survived
the fire because of forest thinning by Registrant around the Engels Mine.
Pursuant to its Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan salvage logging of
dead and dying trees began on Registrants property October 12, 2007 and
will continue until completed. As a result of this wildland fire the registrants
Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan pursuant to the California Forest
Practice Rules will have to be substantially amended.

Registrant is subject to a State of California General Industrial Activities
Storm Water Permit. During the year, pursuant to the Registrants Storm
Water Pollution Prevention Plan, catch and evaporation basins were
maintained. Water sampling was continued by mineral lessee, American
Sheffield Inc.

dated April 18, 2006, American Sheffield Inc., a Nevada Corporation,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Sheffield Resources Ltd., a British Columbia
corporation, exercised its option to enter into a Mining Lease with
Option to Purchase Registrants 36 patented lode mining claims and
162.12 acres of other patented lands at Engelmine. The remaining 77.12

ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
               Condition and Results of Operations

(a) Financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of
 operations.

During the 30 years its mining properties were leased, the
Board of Directors of the Registrant endeavored to increase
working capital, total assets and shareholder's equity in the event
that its lessee, Placer Dome U.S. Inc., terminated its Mining Lease
With Option to Purchase agreement and return the mining properties
to the Registrant. This event occurred effective April 20, 1993.
Thus funds were available to begin preparation of the Non-Industrial
Timber Management Plan.  To provide regular monthly income the
President of the Registrant, on January 1, 2000, transferred his
bookkeeping business to the Registrant. The current Lease and Purchase
agreement and salvage logging operation will provide additional funds
for operation. Changes in working capital, total assets and shareholders
equity for the past five years are summarized as follows:


Changes Working Capital

             2007        2006       2005      2004         2003
           184,301      25,051     47,751    35,052       19,798

The objective of the Board of Directors of the Registrant is to earn
income from the Lease and Purchase agreement, the sale of salvage
timber and its bookkeeping business so funds are available for the
maintenance of its mining properties and the implementation of its
Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan.

(b)  Results of operations.

Registrants principal sources of income are from the Lease and
Purchase agreement, the sale of salvage timber, its bookkeeping
business, interest and dividends. There is no assurance that any
of the sources of income will continue at current rates into the
future.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

This summary of significant accounting policies of California-Engels Mining
Company (the Company) is presented to assist in understanding the
Companys financial statements. The financial statements and notes are
representations of the Company's management who is responsible for their
integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles and have been consistently applied in the
preparation of the financial statements.

Nature of Activity

The Companys principal line of business is development of mineral and
timber properties.  The principal revenue sources currently consist of timber,
land and rock sales, bookkeeping business, investment and rental income.
The Companys properties are located in the western United States.

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly,
actual results could differ from these estimates.

Basis of Accounting

The Company's books are maintained on the accrual method of accounting.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers
all highly liquid debt instruments with a purchased maturity of three months
of less to be cash equivalents. In addition to its bank account, the company
maintains its cash in money market investment accounts which are not
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, the company had $161,765 and $19,982,
respectively, in such accounts. The company has not experienced any
losses in such accounts.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company places its temporary cash investments with financial
institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
financial institution.

Mineral and Timber Lands

Mineral and timber lands and depreciable property are stated at book value
less accumulated depletion and depreciation. Depreciation is calculated
using the declining balance method over five to seven years. Timber depletion
is calculated based on units of production.

NOTE 4 - VALUATION OF MINERAL LANDS
DEFERRED INCOME TAXES

The Mineral lands carried on the books at a value of $10,000 less depletion
have a historical cost basis from June 19, 1901 of $1,000,000.  Beginning
in 1913, different valuations were placed on these lands by the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue.  Under instructions of the Commissioner, the values of
the land were written up on the books to a high of $4,500,000 on
February 23, 1928.

In 1934, because of depressed conditions, the mineral lands were written
down to $10,000 without any tax benefit.  In the event of a sale of these
lands the recognized gain for tax purposes will be substantially reduced
or eliminated. Consequently a deferred tax asset of approximately
$340,000 has been offset by a corresponding valuation allowance
of approximately $340,000 due to the unlikelihood of the sale of the
property in the near future.

It is estimated that the current market value of the properties meets or exceeds
the $1,000,000 historical cost basis; however, due to the length of time the
Company has reported the land values at the written down value of $10,000,
a change to the cost method has not been deemed appropriate for reporting
purposes.

NOTE 6 - INVESTMENT SECURITIES

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, the available-for-sale
securities are reported as an asset at their fair market value with the
unrealized gain or loss excluded from earnings and reported as a component

amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts to maturity. Realized gains and losses are determined using specific
identification of securities sold.

The investment securities portfolio was comprised of items classified as
held-to-maturity at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

The following reflect the estimated fair values of investment securities and
amortized cost held at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005.  Fair values

NOTE 11- MINING LEASE

On April 18, 2006, the Company entered into an Exploration Permit with Option
to Lease and Purchase Agreement with American Sheffield Inc., a Nevada
corporation, wholly owned subsidiary of Sheffield Resources Ltd., a British
Columbia corporation, on its 36 patented lode mining claims and 162.12 acres of
its feelands at Engelmine, Lights Creek Mining District, Plumas County,
California. On August 10, 2006, American Sheffield Inc. excercised its option to
enter into the Lease and Purchase agreement on the Companys property. The
lease provides for annual rental payments, issuance of shares of Sheffield
Resources Ltd., minimum annual work requirement and a net smelter royalty when
in production. The company retained the rights to the timber on the property and
to manage its Engelmine Forest, California Tree Farm # 2611 pursuant to its
Non-Industrial Management Plan.




NOTE 12 - MOONLIGHT FIRE LOSS

The Companys Engelmine Forest tree farm was severely damaged between
September 3-15, 2007 by the 65,000 acre Moonlight Fire on the Plumas National
Forest surrounding the Companys property. Pursuant to its Non-Industrial Timber
Management Plan salvage logging of dead and dying trees began on October 12,
2007 and will continue until complete. As a result of this wildland fire the
Companys Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan pursuant to the California Forest
Practice Rules will need to be substantially amended.

For financial statement purposes, the Company incurred a complete write down
of its timber management plan resulting in a change to the 2007 Statement
of Income in the amount of $91,968. Due to the long holding period of the
land and timber, no significant book value for the timber was carried on the
financial statements, and no impairment loss is warranted. The Company is
performing an on going assessment of the potential economic loss.

Salvage cutting of the timber is expected to continue into 2008.
