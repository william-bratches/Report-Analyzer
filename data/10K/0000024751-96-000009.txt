                                   FORM 10-KSB
                   For the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 1995

                                     Part I

ITEM 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
(a)  Business Development
Corning Natural Gas Corporation (the "Company" or "Registrant"), incorporated in
1904, is a natural gas utility.  The Company purchases its entire supply of gas,
and distributes it through its own pipeline distribution and transmission
systems to residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers in the
Corning, New York area and to two other gas utilities which service the Elmira
and Bath, New York areas.  The Company is under the jurisdiction of the Public
Service Commission of New York State which oversees and sets rates for New York
gas distribution companies.  The transportation of customer owned gas, purchased
on the spot market, through the Company's distribution system continues to
provide substantial revenues.  The Company currently transports for both system
supply and end-use customers.  The Company also sells, leases and services
appliances, primarily gas burning, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Corning
Natural Gas Appliance Corporation.
(b)  Business of Issuer
     (1)  The Company maintains a gas supply portfolio of numerous contracts and
is not dependent on a single supplier.  The Company had no curtailments during
1995 and expects to have an adequate supply available for its customers during
1996 providing that no abnormal conditions or actions occur.
     (2)  The Company is franchised to supply gas service in all the political
subdivisions in which it operates and is adequately protected therewith.
     (3)  Since the Company's business is seasonal by quarters, sales for each
quarter of the year vary and are not comparable.  Sales for calendar years vary
depending on variations in temperature, but the Company's Weather Normalization
Clause (WNC) serves to stabilize net revenue from the effects of temperature
variations. The WNC allows the Company to adjust customer billings to compensate
for fluctuations in net revenue caused by temperatures which are higher or lower
than the thirty year average temperature for the period.  Degree days, which
represent the number of degrees that the average daily temperature falls below
65 degrees Fahrenheit, totaled 6,772 in 1995 and 7,008 in 1994.
     (4)  The Company has three major customers, the details of which appear in
the notes to the financial statements in the attached 1995 Annual Report to
Shareholders which is incorporated by reference thereto.
     (5)  Historically, the Company's competition in the residential market has
been primarily from electricity in cooking, water heating and clothes drying,
and to a very small degree, in heating.  The price of gas remains low in
comparison to that of electricity in the Company's service territory and the
Company's competitive position in the residential market continues to be very
strong.  Approximately 99% of the Company's general service customers heat with
gas.
     In recent years competition from oil has developed in the industrial
market.  The Company has been able to counteract much of this competition, to
date, through the transportation of customer owned gas for a transportation
charge.  The end use customer contracts on the spot market for the purchase of
the gas, usually at substantial savings.  The Company's transportation rate is
equal to the lowest unit rate of the appropriate rate classification, exclusive
of gas costs, hence the profit margin is maintained.  Additionally, under the
recent deregulated environment there is opportunity for the Company to increase
revenue by selling its upstream pipeline capacity to transportation customers.
The Company is authorized to retain 15% of such revenue and 85% is returned to
firm customers in the form of lower gas costs.  Transportation customers that
pay for this capacity are virtually assured that their supply will not be
interrupted.  Revenues derived from the resale of this capacity were $154,033 in
1995 and $244,638 in 1994.  Discounting due to excess capacity available in the
marketplace was primarily responsible for the decrease in revenue.  For those
willing to bear some risk, the Company has an interruptible transportation rate
for its large industrial customers whereby the customer may elect to avoid
payment of demand charges but bears the risk of partial or total upstream
interruption of service during certain periods.  To maintain industrial load in
the event that oil prices temporarily drop below the equivalent gas price, the
Company continues to maintain a flexible transportation rate schedule.  This
flexible rate, however, was not utilized in 1995 and has been invoked only once
since its inception.
     In September 1995 the Company purchased the assets of a local gas
distribution company, Finger Lakes Gas Company, through the Federal Bankruptcy
Court.  Finger Lakes Gas served customers in the Hammondsport, NY area and had a
customer base of approximately 320 customers.  The Company was able to purchase
this all plastic system with a bid of $560,000.  The Company was pleased to
purchase these assets that originally cost over $1.5 million to construct for
its relatively low bid.  The nearly new, all plastic, system was already
connected and serving 320 customers with a potential to add 200 more in the near
future.  On a per customer basis, this represents a very low investment.  The
capital to purchase these assets was obtained through short term debt.  The
Company has not found it necessary to apply for an increase in rates on this
part of our system which means the original rates made effective in 1990 remain
in effect six years later. 
     Shortly after the Company took possession of the system, Mercury Aircraft,
Inc. announced it would purchase the former Taylor Wine Company facilities and
centralize their other plants.  The reopening of this major facility will most
certainly contribute toward the stability and future viability of the new gas
system which is now part of the Company.  The former Finger Lakes Gas Company's
operations, which did not have a significant impact on 1995, are included in the
consolidated results from the acquisition date.
     In December, 1994 the New York Public Service Commission instituted a
proceeding to address issues related to the merging competitive natural gas
market.  This proceeding is intended to provide a framework whereby access to
facilities on upstream pipelines made available by FERC Order 636 would be
available to end use customers on the Local Distribution Company level.  The
Company made the required filings and estimates the new tariff filings to be
approved and become effective May 1, 1996.  The Company considers this a
transitional step towards full unbundling of services with future changes made
as circumstances warrant. 
     The Company currently has a rate application before the New York State
Public Service Commission requesting an increase of approximately 2.5% of
revenues.  Negotiations are on going and the Company expects approval of the
application and the ability to implement the new rates in 1996.
     (6)  The Company believes compliance with present federal, state and local
provisions relating to the protection of the environment will not have any
material adverse effect on capital expenditures, earnings and financial position
of the Company. 
     (7)  Sixty-six persons were employed on a full-time basis and six on a
part-time basis by the Company in 1995 and sixty-seven persons were employed on
a full-time basis and five on a part-time basis during 1994.
     (8)  The Company's labor-management relationship is good.  Typical labor
negotiations are completed in one to two days.  The current labor contract was
signed September 1, 1995 for a three year period.
ITEM 2 - DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
     The Company completed the construction of a new office building at 330 West
William Street, Corning, NY in the fall of 1991.  This structure is physically
connected to the operations center built three years earlier.  The Company had
outgrown its general offices at 27 East Denison Parkway.  That property has been
sold, and the gain on the sale was returned to ratepayers.
     The Company's pipeline system is thoroughly surveyed each year.  Any
necessary replacements are included in the construction budget.  Approximately
105 miles of transmission main, 279 miles of distribution main, 12,749 services
and 86 measuring and regulating stations, along with various other property are
distributed throughout the service area.  All of the above described property is
owned by the Company, except for one short section of 10" gas main which is
leased and which is used primarily to serve Corning Incorporated.  All of the
above described property which is owned by the Company is adequately insured,
and is subject to the lien of the Company's first mortgage indenture.
ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
     The Company is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings, nor
is the Company aware of any problems of any consequence which it anticipates may
result in legal proceedings.
ITEM 4 - SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
     No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of 1995.

                               AGREEMENT

                                BETWEEN

                    CORNING NATURAL GAS CORPORATION

                                  and

                           September 1, 1995


                           A G R E E M E N T

          This Agreement made and entered into at Corning, New York
this 14th day of June, 1995, effective as of September 1, 1995 by and
between Corning Natural Gas Corporation, a New York corporation
(hereinafter referred to as the "Company") and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO, Local 139) hereinafter
referred to as the "Union".

                              WITNESSETH
          WHEREAS, the National Labor Relations Board on March 23,
1967, following a representation election held on March 15, 1967, in
Case No. 3-RC-4093, found, determined and certified that the Union has
been designated and selected by a majority of the employees of the
Company, in the unit described below, as their representative for the
purposes of collective bargaining, and that, pursuant to Section 9(a)
of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, the Union is the
exclusive representative of all the employees in such unit for the

                               - Page 2 -
9/1/95
purposes of collective bargaining with respect to rates of pay, wages,
hours of employment, and other conditions of employment; and the unit
is described as all production and maintenance employ
subdivisions in which it operates and is adequately protected therewith.
     (3)  Since the Company's business is seasonal by quarters, sales for each
quarter of the year vary and are not comparable.  Sales for calendar years vary
depending on variations in temperature, but the Company's Weather Normalization
Clause (WNC) serves to stabilize net revenue from the effects of temperature
variations. The WNC allows the Company to adjust customer billings to compensate
for fluctuations in net revenue caused by temperatures which are higher or lower
than the thirty year average temperature for the period.  Degree days, which
represent the number of degrees that the average daily temperature falls below
65 degrees Fahrenheit, totaled 6,772 in 1995 and 7,008 in 1994.
     (4)  The Company has three major customers, the details of which appear in
the notes to the financial statements in the attached 1995 Annual Report to
Shareholders which is incorporated by reference thereto.
     (5)  Historically, the Company's competition in the residential market has
been primarily from electricity in cooking, water heating and clothes drying,
and to a very small degree, in heating.  The price of gas remains low in
comparison to that of electricity in the Company's service territory and the
Company's competitive position in the residential market continues to be very
strong.  Approximately 99% of the Company's general service customers heat with
gas.
     In recent years competition from oil has developed in the industrial
market.  The Company has been able to counteract much of this competition, to
date, through the transportation of customer owned gas for a transportation
charge.  The end use customer contracts on the spot market for the purchase of
the gas, usually at substantial savings.  The Company's transportation rate is
equal to the lowest unit rate of the appropriate rate classification, exclusive
of gas costs, hence the profit margin is maintained.  Additionally, under the
recent deregulated environment there is opportunity for the Company to increase
revenue by selling its upstream pipeline capacity to transportation customers.
The Company is authorized to retain 15% of such revenue and 85% is returned to
firm customers in the form of lower gas costs.  Transportation customers that
pay for this capacity are virtually assured that their supply will not be
interrupted.  Revenues derived from the resale of this capacity were $154,033 in
1995 and $244,638 in 1994.  Discounting due to excess capacity available in the
marketplace was primarily responsible for the decrease in revenue.  For those
willing to bear some risk, the Company has an interruptible transportation rate
for its large industrial customers whereby the customer may elect to avoid
payment of demand charges but bears the risk of partial or total upstream
interruption of service during certain periods.  To maintain industrial load in
the event that oil prices temporarily drop below the equivalent gas price, the
Company continues to maintain a flexible transportation rate schedule.  This
flexible rate, however, was not utilized in 1995 and has been invoked only once
since its inception.
     In September 1995 the Company purchased the assets of a local gas
distribution company, Finger Lakes Gas Company, through the Federal Bankruptcy
Court.  Finger Lakes Gas served customers in the Hammondsport, NY area and had a
customer base of approximately 320 customers.  The Company was able to purchase
this all plastic system with a bid of $560,000.  The Company was pleased to
purchase these assets that originally cost over $1.5 million to construct for
its relatively low bid.  The nearly new, all plastic, system was already
connected and serving 320 customers with a potential to add 200 more in the near
future.  On a per customer basis, this represents a very low investment.  The
capital to purchase these assets was obtained through short term debt.  The
Company has not found it necessary to apply for an increase in rates on this
part of our system which means the original rates made effective in 1990 remain
in effect six years later. 
     Shortly after the Company took possession of the system, Mercury Aircraft,
Inc. announced it would purchase the former Taylor Wine Company facilities and
centralize their other plants.  The reopening of this major facility will most
certainly contribute toward the stability and future viability of the new gas
system which is now part of the Company.  The former Finger Lakes Gas Company's
operations, which did not have a significant impact on 1995, are included in the
consolidated results from the acquisition date.
     In December, 1994 the New York Public Service Commission instituted a
proceeding to address issues related to the merging competitive natural gas
market.  This proceeding is intended to provide a framework whereby access to
facilities on upstream pipelines made available by FERC Order 636 would be
available to end use customers on the Local Distribution Company level.  The
Company made the required filings and estimates the new tariff filings to be
approved and become effective May 1, 1996.  The Company considers this a
transitional step towards full unbundling of services with future changes made
as circumstances warrant. 
     The Company currently has a rate application before the New York State
Public Service Commission requesting an increase of approximately 2.5% of
revenues.  Negotiations are on going and the Company expects approval of the
application and the ability to implement the new rates in 1996.
     (6)  The Company believes compliance with present federal, state and local
provisions relating to the protection of the environment will not have any
material adverse effect on capital expenditures, earnings and financial position
of the Company. 
     (7)  Sixty-six persons were employed on a full-time basis and six on a
part-time basis by the Company in 1995 and sixty-seven persons were employed on
a full-time basis and five on a part-time basis during 1994.
     (8)  The Company's labor-management relationship is good.  Typical labor
negotiations are completed in one to two days.  The current labor contract was
signed September 1, 1995 for a three year period.
ITEM 2 - DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
     The Company completed the construction of a new office building at 330 West
William Street, Corning, NY in the fall of 1991.  This structure is physically
connected to the operations center built three years earlier.  The Company had
outgrown its general offices at 27 East Denison Parkway.  That property has been
sold, and the gain on the sale was returned to ratepayers.
     The Company's pipeline system is thoroughly surveyed each year.  Any
necessary replacements are included in the construction budget.  Approximately
105 miles of transmission main, 279 miles of distribution main, 12,749 services
and 86 measuring and regulating stations, along with various other property are
distributed throughout the service area.  All of the above described property is
owned by the Company, except for one short section of 10" gas main which is
leased and which is used primarily to serve Corning Incorporated.  All of the
above described property which is owned by the Company is adequately insured,
and is subject to the lien of the Company's first mortgage indenture.
ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
     The Company is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings, nor
is the Company aware of any problems of any consequence which it anticipates may
result in legal proceedings.
ITEM 4 - SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
     No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of 1995.

1967, following a representation election held on March 15, 1967, in
Case No. 3-RC-4093, found, determined and certified that the Union has
been designated and selected by a majority of the employees of the
Company, in the unit described below, as their representative for the
purposes of collective bargaining, and that, pursuant to Section 9(a)
of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, the Union is the
exclusive representative of all the employees in such unit for the

                               - Page 2 -
9/1/95
purposes of collective bargaining with respect to rates of pay, wages,
hours of employment, and other conditions of employment; and the unit
is described as all production and maintenance employ
subdivisions in which it operates and is adequately protected therewith.
     (3)  Since the Company's business is seasonal by quarters, sales for each
quarter of the year vary and are not comparable.  Sales for calendar years vary
depending on variations in temperature, but the Company's Weather Normalization
Clause (WNC) serves to stabilize net revenue from the effects of temperature
variations. The WNC allows the Company to adjust customer billings to compensate
for fluctuations in net revenue caused by temperatures which are higher or lower
than the thirty year average temperature for the period.  Degree days, which
represent the number of degrees that the average daily temperature falls below
65 degrees Fahrenheit, totaled 6,772 in 1995 and 7,008 in 1994.
     (4)  The Company has three major customers, the details of which appear in
the notes to the financial statements in the attached 1995 Annual Report to
Shareholders which is incorporated by reference thereto.
     (5)  Historically, the Company's competition in the residential market has
been primarily from electricity in cooking, water heating and clothes drying,
and to a very small degree, in heating.  The price of gas remains low in
comparison to that of electricity in the Company's service territory and the
Company's competitive position in the residential market continues to be very
strong.  Approximately 99% of the Company's general service customers heat with
gas.
     In recent years competition from oil has developed in the industrial
market.  The Company has been able to counteract much of this competition, to
date, through the transportation of customer owned gas for a transportation
charge.  The end use customer contracts on the spot market for the purchase of
the gas, usually at substantial savings.  The Company's transportation rate is
equal to the lowest unit rate of the appropriate rate classification, exclusive
of gas costs, hence the profit margin is maintained.  Additionally, under the
recent deregulated environment there is opportunity for the Company to increase
revenue by selling its upstream pipeline capacity to transportation customers.
The Company is authorized to retain 15% of such revenue and 85% is returned to
firm customers in the form of lower gas costs.  Transportation customers that
pay for this capacity are virtually assured that their supply will not be
interrupted.  Revenues derived from the resale of this capacity were $154,033 in
1995 and $244,638 in 1994.  Discounting due to excess capacity available in the
marketplace was primarily responsible for the decrease in revenue.  For those
willing to bear some risk, the Company has an interruptible transportation rate
for its large industrial customers whereby the customer may elect to avoid
payment of demand charges but bears the risk of partial or total upstream
interruption of service during certain periods.  To maintain industrial load in
the event that oil prices temporarily drop below the equivalent gas price, the
Company continues to maintain a flexible transportation rate schedule.  This
flexible rate, however, was not utilized in 1995 and has been invoked only once
since its inception.
     In September 1995 the Company purchased the assets of a local gas
distribution company, Finger Lakes Gas Company, through the Federal Bankruptcy
Court.  Finger Lakes Gas served customers in the Hammondsport, NY area and had a
customer base of approximately 320 customers.  The Company was able to purchase
this all plastic system with a bid of $560,000.  The Company was pleased to
purchase these assets that originally cost over $1.5 million to construct for
its relatively low bid.  The nearly new, all plastic, system was already
connected and serving 320 customers with a potential to add 200 more in the near
future.  On a per customer basis, this represents a very low investment.  The
capital to purchase these assets was obtained through short term debt.  The
Company has not found it necessary to apply for an increase in rates on this
part of our system which means the original rates made effective in 1990 remain
in effect six years later. 
     Shortly after the Company took possession of the system, Mercury Aircraft,
Inc. announced it would purchase the former Taylor Wine Company facilities and
centralize their other plants.  The reopening of this major facility will most
certainly contribute toward the stability and future viability of the new gas
system which        Form 10-K for December 31, 1987.

          WHEREAS, the National Labor Relations Board on March 23,
