PART I


Item 1.   Description of Business


     The registrant and its predecessors have been engaged in the manufacture
and sale of quality leisure footwear since 1882.  The Daniel Green Company
slipper is one of the oldest and best known in the footwear industry. 
Materials in Daniel Green slippers include satin, rayon, corduroy, nylon,
brocade, felt, polyurethane and several types of leather.
 
     Women's slippers and leisure footwear, which normally account for above
90% of the registrant's annual sales, retail within a price range varying
from $22.00 a pair to $65.00 a pair.  Men's slippers are sold at prices
ranging between $19.00 and $50.00 a pair.  The registrant produces about 35
to 45 styles of slippers and 45 to 50 styles  of leisure footwear, many of
which change from year to year.  The registrant designs most of its own
styles, having for many years maintained a style research department. 
Several styles are imported and are designed by the overseas manufacturers. 
Most of the slippers and leisure footwear are sold under the Company name or
the trademarks Comfy, Outdorables, and Dee Gee.  In 1993, the Company
launched a new private label division, which produces shoes without Daniel
Green's name being mentioned on the product or box. This division accounted
for approximately 14.9% of all pairs shipped during 1993, 11.5% in 1994, and
3.4% in 1995.

     Most of the slippers and leisure footwear sold by the registrants are
manufactured in its plants in Dolgeville, New York (more fully described in
Item 2 - Property).  The Company has increased the number and volume of
imported styles in order to improve efficiencies in its facilities, to reduce
seasonal demands on its manufacturing capacities, and to improve
competitiveness.  In 1995, the Company began importing shoe parts from
overseas.  This allows the Company to increase its overall production by
eliminating production bottlenecks, and helps to improve cost
competitiveness.  The registrant has experienced no difficulty in obtaining
the raw materials needed to manufacture its products.  The registrant has
never made a practice of entering into long-term purchase contracts.

     The registrant's products are sold directly to retailers through its own
sales force which covers the entire United States.  Approximately 9,000
dealers carry Daniel Green Company slippers and leisure footwear, including
most of the major department stores in the country.  Export sales to Canada
have increased slightly due to the gradual elimination of restrictive tariffs
and duties.  One customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's
business in 1995.  No customer of the Company accounted for 10% or more of
net sales in 1993 or 1994, and no material part of the business is dependent
upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of any one or more of
whom would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.  The
registrant advertises its products through leading nationally distributed
magazines and for many years has built its advertising campaigns around the
trademark Comfy.  It avoids granting restricted or exclusive sales
arrangements, believing that distribution of its type of merchandise requires
the greatest number of outlets.  Private label products are sold to a number
of companies by an internal salesman.  No one company accounts for a majority
of the business for that division.

     The registrant's business is a seasonal one.  By offering a June 10th
payment date to customers buying slippers for shipment between January 1st
and May 10th, the registrant has been able to encourage customers to
replenish their stock more evenly throughout the year.  Dating privileges are
also given for payment on May 10th for all Spring Outdorables shipped between
November 25th and March 24th, and a November 10th dating for Fall Outdorables
shipped between June 1st and September 24th.  However, the majority of
registrant's sales are generated during the latter half of the year.  In an
effort to encourage earlier shipments, the registrant offers a Christmas
dating which allows customers to pay on December 10th for orders of slippers
and Dee Gee's shipped between June 1st and October 24th.

     The registrant experiences severe competition in the sale of its
slippers from other manufacturers of leisure footwear, particularly imports. 
It maintains an active research and development staff which concentrate on
improving manufacturing techniques, order processing, and plant scheduling. 
It owns several design patents but does not depend on these to enable it to
compete successfully.  The registrant is not aware of any patents held by
others which might materially affect its ability to compete.

     The registrant believes that a definite competitive advantage attaches
to its ownership of the registered trademarks Comfy and Dee Gee which have
been used by the registrant for many years.

     The registrant knows of no material effects that compliance with
federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials
into the environment  may have upon the capital expenditures, earnings and
competitive position of the registrant.

     The registrant has enjoyed an excellent relationship with its
approximately 350 employees, most of whom are full time.   All of the
registrant's employees, except for the salesmen, are employed in its plants
at Dolgeville, New York.

     The amount of registrant's backlog orders believed to be firm as of
December 31, 1995 is $543,413 as compared with $759,901 as of December 31,
1994 and $1,608,941 as of December 31, 1993.  All backlog orders are expected
to be filled within the next fiscal year.  The backlog orders are a normal
aspect of the registrant's business due to its seasonal nature.  The
registrant experienced a decrease in backlog orders in 1995 due to the very
poor holiday retail season preceding year-end.  This caused retailers to be
overstocked and reduced fill-in orders scheduled for January 1996.  



Item 2.   Description of Properties.

     The registrant's executive offices and manufacturing facilities are
located in Dolgeville, New York.  This site consists of approximately 15
acres of land on which there is a group of multi-storied buildings containing
approximately 326,000 square feet of floor space.  These buildings are
constructed principally of wood and limestone.  The principal buildings were
built between 1882 and 1890.

     The registrant's real property, equipment and other fixed assets are
maintained in good condition and actively utilized.



     Registrant believes that its plants, which contain a variety of
machinery for the manufacture of leisure footwear, are adequate to maintain
present production output.

     All registrant's buildings are owned outright.  A small portion of the
registrant's production machinery is leased.  An updated computer mainframe
and state-of-the-art telephone equipment were installed under a capital lease
arrangement.

     The registrant maintains only one sales office which is located in
leased premises in the Empire State Building in New York City.
