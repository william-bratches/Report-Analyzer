<P>Church Loans &amp;  Investments  Trust ("the Trust") is a real estate investment
trust organized under the laws of the State of Texas in March 1963. Although the
Trust has the authority to engage in the business of buying, selling and leasing
of real estate,  the Trust has  heretofore  restricted  its business  activities
primarily  to making  loans to churches and other  nonprofit  organizations  and
assisted  living  centers  which are secured by a first  mortgage on real estate
owned by such borrowers.</P>

<P>The period of duration of the Trust, unless dissolved in accordance with law, or
by the consent of the owners of shares of beneficial  interest in the Trust,  is
perpetual.  The Trust may be dissolved by the affirmative  vote of not less than
two-thirds of the owners of outstanding shares of the Trust.</P>

<P>The control and management of the Trust properties,  and all powers necessary or
appropriate  to  effect  any and all of the  purposes  for  which  the  Trust is
organized, is vested in the Board of Trust Managers.</P>


<P>The  number of shares of  beneficial  interest  in the Trust  which the Trust is
authorized to issue is unlimited.</P>

<P>The Trust is  qualified  as a "real  estate  investment  trust"  under  Sections
856-858 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the "Internal  Revenue
Code" or "Code").  It is the  intention of the Trust to continue to qualify as a
real estate investment trust under the Code.</P>

<P>The Trust  maintains  an office  located at 5305 I-40 West,  Amarillo,  TX 79106
(telephone 806/358-3666).</P>

<P>As mentioned  above,  the Trust is  primarily  engaged in the business of making
mortgage loans to churches and other nonprofit organizations and assisted living
centers.  The  Declaration  of Trust  restricts the  investments of the Trust to
loans  secured by a first  mortgage,  deed of trust or other lien  covering real
property with the amount of such loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of the value of the
real  property  securing  such loan as  determined  by a  competent  independent
appraiser.  Although  the Trust has been  primarily  in the  business  of making
long-term  mortgage  loans,  during  the past  several  years  it has also  been
actively involved in making short-term  interim or construction loans to finance
the  construction  of church  buildings,  the  construction  of assisted  living
centers,   the  purchase  of  real  estate,   or  the  refinancing  of  existing
indebtedness.  Most of the interim loans  presently  being made by the Trust are
associated with bond offerings of churches and other nonprofit organizations and
assisted living centers. These interim loans are scheduled to be repaid from the
proceeds of the bond offerings.</P>

<P>The Trust is not limited to the location of the  property  securing any loans in
which it may invest and seeks to spread its  investments  in areas of the United
States where favorable yields prevail.</P>

<P>As of March 31, 2003, the Trust has 87 permanent and interim  mortgage loans and
investments in church bonds having a principal balance of $54,772,437,  with the
average  principal  amount thereof</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-4-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<P>being  $629,568.  The  interest  rates on these loans vary from 4.75% to 12% per
annum with the weighted average interest rate of mortgage loans and church bonds
being 7.80% per annum at March 31,  2003.The  original terms of these loans vary
from one year to  thirty  years,  with the  majority  being for a term of twenty
years.</P>

<P>During the fiscal year of the Trust ending March 31, 2003, the net income of the
Trust was  $3,113,639,  as compared to  $3,281,795 in fiscal 2002, a decrease of
5.12%.  Such  decrease  in net income of the Trust was due to a decrease  in the
Trust's  net  interest  income.  Net  interest  income of the Trust was lower in
fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 due to several  reasons,  including:  (a)
the  payment in 2002 of several  loans  owing to the Trust that were  previously
characterized  as  non-performing,  and (b) a decrease in the net interest  rate
margin of the Trust.</P>

<P>The net income of the Trust for each of the quarters  during  fiscal 2003 was as
follows:    first   quarter-   $767,801;    second    quarter-$646,919;    third
quarter-$747,012; and fourth quarter-$951,907.</P>

<P>The operational  expense of the Trust increased from $785,512 during fiscal 2002
to  $830,160  in fiscal  2003.  The  operational  expense of the Trust  included
general and administrative  expenses and compensation to members of the Board of
Trust Managers.</P>

<P>During fiscal 2003, the Trust advanced loan proceeds of $25,465,901 on 13
interim loans and 15  permanent  loans.  Most,  if not all,  of such loans bear
interest at a variable  rate  varying from 1.5% to 2% per annum in excess of the
prime rate of interest  published  by the Wall  Street  Journal and known as the
"Wall Street Journal Prime."</P>

<P>During  fiscal 2003,  the Trust  employed a total of 5 full time  employees  and
employed,  as needed,  two additional  part-time  persons who work on a contract
basis</P>

<P>The business  conditions in which the Trust operates has become more competitive
in the past several years as more and more banks are re-entering the business of
making loans to churches,  especially  the more  desirable,  less risky,  church
loans.  If this trend  continues,  the rates and fees which the trust can charge
may decrease.  However,  loan demand  remains good as evidenced by the number of
loan  requests  received  by the  Trust  and  the  number  of  loan  commitments
outstanding as of March 31, 2003.</P>

<P>At your request,  we will provide you, without charge, a copy of any exhibits to
this Annual Report on Form 10-KSB.  If more information is needed,  please call,

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Item 2 - DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY</FONT></H2>

<P>The Trust  maintains as its only place of business  its offices  located at 5305
I-40  West,  in  Amarillo,  Texas.  Such  building  is owned by the Trust and is
occupied  solely by the  Trust.  There is no debt owed by Trust in regard to its
real property.</P>

<P>The real properties of the Trust,  net of depreciation and excluding real estate
acquired  through  foreclosure,  are not a  significant  portion of the  Trust's
assets, representing less than 1% of the Trust's total assets.</P>

<P>As previously mentioned, the Trust's primary business is the making of
mortgage loans to churches and other nonprofit organizations and assisted living
centers. The Declaration of Trust restricts the investments of the Trust to
loans secured by a first mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien covering real
property with the amount of such loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of the value of the
real property securing such loan. However, the Trust has made one loan in May of
2003 for $150,000 that is secured by a second mortgage lien against real estate having
a total  estimated  value of  $7,312,100.  Such loan is second and inferior to a
loan secured by a first mortgage in the approximate amount of $2,500,000. The
Declaration  of Trust may not be amended  without the  affirmative  vote of two-thirds (2/3rds) of the Certificates of Beneficial Interest entitled to vote. The
Board of Trust Managers'  general policy is to limit  investment of Trust assets
in any one mortgage loan to not more than $3,000,000. However, at the discretion
of the Board of Trust Managers,  the Trust may make and has made loans in excess
of such  limit.  All such  investment  in  mortgage  loans is for the purpose of
earning income for the Trust.</P>

<P><B>Results of Operations 2003 compared to 2002</B></P>

<blockquote>

<P>During the fiscal year ended  March 31,  2003,  interest  income and fees of the
Trust decreased by $389,632 (7.36%) over the previous fiscal year. However,  the
interest  income of the Trust  for the  fiscal  year  ended  March 31,  2002 was
significantly influenced by the payment of several loans owing to the Trust that
were  previously  characterized  as  non-performing.  The pay-off of these loans
resulted  in an  additional  recognition  of  interest  income of  approximately
$586,000 in fiscal 2002 as compared  with interest  income  recognized in fiscal
2003 on the pay-off of loans  previously  characterized  as non-  performing  of
approximately  $164,000,  a difference of $422,000.  Interest income and fees of
the Trust after  deducting the interest  income received on the payment of loans
which were previously  characterized as  nonperforming  was $4,738,182 in fiscal
2003 as compared to $4,705,814 in fiscal 2002, an increase of $32,368 or 0.69%.</P>

<blockquote>

<P>The  decrease in  interest  income and fees of the Trust in fiscal 2003 was also
attributable  to a decrease in the interest rates on the Trust's loan portfolio.
The average  interest rate on loans and church bonds held by the Trust decreased
from 9.14% as of March 31, 2002, to 7.80% as of March 31, 2003.</P>

<P>There was a slight  increase in the amount of  performing  interim loans held by
the Trust from  $15,317,011 as of March 31, 2002, to $15,672,768 as of March 31,
2003,  and there was an increase in performing  mortgage  loans and church bonds
during  the  recent  fiscal  year  from  $30,507,636  as of March 31,  2002,  to
$35,689,239 as of March 31, 2003. In addition,  non-performing  loans  increased
from  $1,151,907  as of March 31,  2002,  to  $2,834,574  as of March 31,  2003.
Therefore,  the total performing and non-performing mortgage loans, church bonds
and interim loans held by the Trust  increased from  $46,976,554 as of March 31,
2002, to $54,196,581 as of March 31, 2003. This increase is partially the result
of a decrease in the  payments  received on mortgage  and interim  loans  during
fiscal 2003 of $17,755,086 as compared to $27,454,632  during fiscal 2002.  This
represents a decrease of $9,699,546 or 35.33%.  The increase in mortgage  loans,
church bonds and interim loans held by the Trust was offset by a decrease in the
investment by the Trust in mortgage and interim loans from  $32,691,886  for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2002,  to  $25,465,901  during the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2003.  The decrease in the  investment by the Trust in mortgage  loans
also contributed to a decrease of $19,145 in commitment fees earned by the Trust
in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002.</P>

<P>The net income of the Trust for fiscal 2003 was $3,113,639  ($.44 per share),  a
decrease of $168,156  (5.12%) from the previous  fiscal year.  Such decrease was
primarily  attributable  to a decrease in the Trust's net interest  income.  Net
interest income decreased from $4,302,595 in fiscal 2002 to $3,927,582 in fiscal
2003, a decrease of $375,013 (8.72%) from fiscal 2002.</P>

<P>The  decrease  in the net  income of the Trust for  fiscal  2003 was offset by a
slight  decrease  in the  interest  expense of the Trust.  In fiscal  2003,  the
average  aggregate  amount of total debt outstanding was $7,945,467 more than in
fiscal 2002.  However,  the weighted  average interest rate decreased from 5.12%
for the year ended March 31,  2002,  to 3.58% for the year ended March 31, 2003.
The interest  expense of the Trust  decreased  from $989,219 for the fiscal year
ended March 31,  2002,  to $974,600  for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, a
decrease of $14,619 or 1.48%. The average  month-end balance of the indebtedness
owing by the Trust  increased from  $19,125,126  for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2002, to $27,070,593 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003. Such increase
was due to an increase in the debt of the Trust  resulting  from the decrease in
the payments  received by the Trust on mortgage and interim loans. The effect on
interest  expense of  increased  debt was offset by the  decrease in the Trust's
cost of funds as previously mentioned.</P>

<P>Income from the realization of loan discounts from loan purchases decreased from
$264,694 for the year ended March 31, 2002,  to $40,528 for the year ended March
31, 2003, a decrease of $224,166.</P>

<P>General and administrative expenses of the Trust increased from $733,957 for the
fiscal year ended March 31,  2002,  to $771,378  for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2003, an increase of $37,421 or 5.10%.</P>

Dividends  related to fiscal 2003,  without  regard to dates they were declared,
were  $2,730,315  or $.39 per share as compared to  $3,360,387 or $.48 per share
for fiscal 2002. The decrease in dividends paid was primarily  attributable to a
decrease in the net income of the Trust. As a real estate  investment trust,

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-9-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<blockquote>

<P>the Trust was required by Section 857 of the Internal Revenue Code to distribute
not less  than 95% of its  taxable  net  income  to its  shareholders.  In 1999,
Section 857 of the Code was amended to reduce this  requirement to not less than
90%. In fiscal 2002 and 2003,  the Trust elected to reduce its  dividends  based
upon this lower requirement.  Dividends are based on taxable income which varies
from net income  reported  in the  financial  statements  because  of  temporary
differences  (differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its
reported  amount in the  financial  statements  that will  result in  taxable or
deductible  amounts in future  years).  In fiscal  2002,  the Trust  distributed
dividends  equal to 92.7% of its net  taxable  income  as  compared  to 92.5% in
fiscal 2003.  Future  dividends may be more or less than the net income reported
in the financial statements because of variances in these temporary differences.</P>

<P>During  fiscal  2003,  the  prime  interest  rate  decreased  from  4.75% at the
beginning  of the fiscal year to 4.25% at the close of the fiscal  year.  Should
the prime interest rate decrease during fiscal 2004, the interest expense of the
Trust will  generally  decrease  and the net income of the Trust will,  in turn,
generally increase.  Should the prime interest rate increase during fiscal 2004,
the interest expense of the Trust will generally  increase and the net income of
the Trust will, in turn, generally decrease.</P>

<P>Other income of the Trust  increased from $32,203 for fiscal 2002 to $86,145 for
fiscal  2003.  Included in fiscal 2003 income is a gain of $9,320 on the sale of
properties which the Trust had obtained through foreclosure.</P>

<P><B>Liquidity and Capital Resources</B></P>

<blockquote>

<P>The Trust is engaged  primarily in the business of making  permanent and interim
loans to churches and other  non-profit  organizations,  and to other borrowers,
including  businesses  engaged in the building and operation of assisted  living
centers.  At March 31, 2003, the Trust had five loans to two different borrowers
which are  secured  by  assisted  living  centers  which  totaled  approximately
$7,961,000.   Three  of  these  loans  were  to  affiliated  borrowers  totaling
approximately  $1,660,000  and with the remaining two loans to another  borrower
totaling approximately $6,301,000.</P>

<P>The assets of the Trust  primarily  consist of its loan  portfolio,  real estate
acquired  through  foreclosure  and its  office  building  and  facilities.  The
operational  expense of the Trust is comprised of the  maintenance of its office
building,  the payment of the  salaries  of its  management  and support  staff,
office expenses,  fees paid to the Board of Trust Managers,  and the payment for
legal  and  accounting  services.  Substantially  all of the  Trust  assets  are
invested  in the  permanent  and  interim  loans  made by the  Trust.  The  only
potential  liquidity  problems of the Trust are related to the timely and proper
repayment by the Trust of the  leveraged  funds it has borrowed to make loans in
excess of its  capital and the ability to fund loan  commitments  which  totaled
approximately $8,300,000 at March 31, 2003. All of the indebtedness of the Trust
is generally classified as short term having maturities ranging from "on demand"
to maturities repayable over various periods extending through fiscal 2004.</P>

<P>All of the debt  obligations  of the Trust  outstanding as of March 31, 2003, in
the amount of  $32,370,714  will mature in fiscal 2004.  These debt  obligations
primarily consist of the Trust's bank line of credit and Master Note Agreements.
As of April 14, 2003,  the Trust  modified its loan  agreement with the Amarillo
National  Bank  thereby  increasing  the  line of  credit  from  $24,000,000  to
$35,000,000. Although the Trust's bank line of credit matures in fiscal 2004, it
is anticipated  that the line of credit will</P>

</blockquote>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-10-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<blockquote>

<P>be renewed annually.  In the event that the bank elects not to renew the line of
credit,  the Trust may under the terms of the loan agreement  retire the line of
credit over a period of time,  not to exceed five years,  equal to the  weighted
average  remaining  term of all real  estate  lien notes of the Trust  which are
pledged to secure the bank line of credit.</P>

<P>At March 31, 2003, loans to the Trust under Master Note Agreements, which are in
effect demand notes, total $13,448,714.  In the past, the Trust has utilized its
bank line of credit and the  principal  paid to the Trust  upon its  outstanding
loan portfolio in order to meet its maturing obligations.</P>

<P>At March 31,  2003,  the  balance  which could be borrowed by the Trust upon its
bank line of credit was  $5,078,000.  The  principal  payments  scheduled  to be
received by the Trust upon its loan  portfolio  for the years  ending  March 31,
2004 and 2005 are  $17,512,433  and  $2,140,143,  respectively.  Assuming all of
these scheduled principal payments are received,  these payments,  together with
the balance available to the Trust on its bank line of credit, would not provide
the Trust with sufficient  funds to meet its maturing  obligations and fund loan
commitments  without  the  necessity  of the Trust  borrowing  funds  from other
sources.</P>

<P>As mentioned  above,  the Trust  obtained an increase in its bank line of credit
from $24,000,000 to $35,000,000 effective April 14, 2003. Based upon the success
of the Trust to obtain  borrowings  in the past,  the Trust is  confident  that,
should it be necessary,  it will be able to obtain  additional bank financing in
the  future  in  sufficient  amounts  for the  Trust to  timely  meet all of its
obligations.</P>

<P>Should all the scheduled  principal payments upon loans made by the Trust not be
received,  and should the Trust be unable to borrow  against its line of credit,
and should borrowings from other sources not be available, it would be necessary
for the Trust to sell a portion of its mortgage  loan  portfolio in order for it
to meet all of its  financial  obligations.  At March 31,  2003,  the  principal
balance of the loan and church bond portfolio of the Trust was $54,196,581,  net
of unamortized  purchase discounts.  The weighted average interest rate on loans
and church  bonds was 7.80% per annum.  In view of the normal  marketability  of
conventional  loans, the Trust might be required to discount a majority of these
loans in order for them to be attractive for purchase.  The principal  amount of
these loans if discounted to yield a weighted  average interest rate of 12%, 14%
and 16% would be $35,227,778, $30,195,236, and $26,420,831,  respectively. There
is no  assurance  that the Trust would be able to sell all, or a portion of, its
portfolio  of loans,  in which  event,  it would be  necessary  for the Trust to
secure a loan,  or  loans,  from a lender  in  order  for the  Trust to meet its
financial  obligations.  There is no  assurance  that the Trust would be able to
secure a loan in such instance.  The Trust has sold only one of the loans in its
mortgage loan portfolio and, therefore, has limited experience in this area.</P>

<P>Principal payments scheduled to be received by the Trust upon its permanent loan
portfolio  during the years ending March 31, 2004 and 2005,  if not used to fund
new loan  commitments,  would be used to reduce the outstanding  indebtedness of
the  Trust.  Should  the Trust use the  payments  of  principal  which  shall be
received upon its loan  portfolio to reduce its  outstanding  indebtedness,  the
interest  expense of the Trust will  decrease.  In such  instance,  whether  the
decrease in the interest  income will exceed,  or be less than,  the decrease in
the interest  expense will largely be dependent  upon the prime rate of interest
prevailing  at such time due to the fact that the  interest  to be earned by the
Trust upon its mortgage loan  portfolio is generally  based upon a fixed rate of
interest or a variable rate of interest that</P>

<P>periodically  reprices,  while the  interest  to be paid by the  Trust  upon its
outstanding debts is directly, or indirectly, tied to the prime rate of interest
charged by major domestic banks.</P>

<P>As of March 31, 2003, a substantial  portion of the promissory  notes evidencing
the loans made by the Trust have been pledged to secure the Trust's bank line of
credit. Promissory notes totaling $22,258,871 were pledged against the bank line
of credit which had a total  outstanding  balance of  $18,922,000.  The required
collateral for this bank loan was  $20,814,200,  leaving an excess of promissory
notes  which have been  pledged to secure said bank notes of  $1,444,671.  These
excess promissory notes may be reassigned by the bank to the Trust to be sold in
order for the Trust to meet its financial  obligations.  Should it be necessary,
in order for the Trust to meet its  financial  obligations,  these  excess notes
amounting to $1,444,671 and other additional promissory notes in the approximate
amount of $31,937,710 (for a total amount of $33,382,381)  would be available to
be sold by the  Trust to meet  its  financial  obligations.  Should  the  excess
promissory  notes be assigned by the bank to the Trust as heretofore  described,
the bank line of credit would  continue to be secured by the  required  ratio of
notes pledged to the principal  balance of the bank line of credit.  There is no
assurance  that the Trust would be able to sell all,  or any  portion of,  these
notes.</P>

<P>Cash flows from  operating  activities  consists  primarily  of net income.  The
primary  components  of net income are  interest  income and  expense.  Interest
income  should  continue  to be the main source of cash  provided  by  operating
activities;  however,  the  availability of this cash flow is dependent upon the
ability of the borrowers to repay loans.  Although  there was an increase in the
amount of non-performing loans as of March 31, 2003, compared to March 31, 2002,
cash  provided  by  operating  activities  has  been  and  is  expected  to be a
relatively stable source of cash flow.</P>

<P>Cash flows from investing  activities  results  primarily from investment in and
payments received on mortgage and interim construction loans and church bonds.</P>

<P>Cash flows from  financing  activities  relate  primarily to the  borrowings and
payments on notes payable and the line of credit.  Borrowings  are made as funds
are needed to make loans or as current  obligations  become due.  Based upon the
success of the Trust to obtain  borrowings  in the past,  the Trust is confident
that it will be able to obtain  borrowings in the future in sufficient  amounts,
along with payments to be received on loans, to timely meet its obligations.</P>

</blockquote>

<P><B>Inflation</B></P>

<blockquote>

<P>At March 31, 2003, the weighted  average  interest rate on the mortgage loan and
church  bond  portfolio  of the Trust was  7.80%  per annum  while the  weighted
average  interest  rate upon all  borrowings  of the Trust was 3.25% per  annum.
Although a majority of the loans  constituting  the loan  portfolio of the Trust
have been made at  variable  rates of interest  that  generally  reprice  either
daily, annually, or otherwise periodically,  a portion of the loans constituting
the  Trust's  loan  portfolio  have been  made at fixed  rates of  interest  and
therefore are not subject to being increased or decreased during the term of the
loan. All of the indebtedness of the Trust is either directly or indirectly tied
to the  prime  rate of  interest  charged  by major  banking  institutions  and,
therefore,  is subject to  fluctuation.  During periods of inflation,  the prime
rate of interest charged by major banking institutions,  as well as the interest
rate  or  cost  of  borrowing  money  from  any  lender,   generally  increases.
Consequently, during an inflationary</P>

period the  interest  expense of the Trust would  increase.  Since the  interest
income of the Trust would not  increase as rapidly,  an increase in the interest
expense  of the Trust  would  decrease  the net  income of the  Trust.  However,
interest  income should  subsequently  increase as variable rate loans  reprice.
Should the amount of the loans and the amount of the  indebtedness  of the Trust
remain  constant,  and  should  the  weighted  average  interest  rate  upon the
indebtedness increase to approximately 13.06% per annum, the interest income and
the interest expense of the Trust would be substantially equal.

<P><B>New Accounting Standards</B></P>

<blockquote>

<P>In June 2001,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued  Statements of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 141,  Business  Combinations,  and No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. Under these rules,  goodwill and intangible  assets deemed to
have indefinite  lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual
impairment tests in accordance with the Statements. Other intangible assets will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives.</P>

<P>The Trust applied the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other  intangible
assets as of April 1, 2002. Application of the nonamortization provisions of the
statement  did not have an effect on net  income as the Trust  currently  has no

2002, and the related statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows
for the years then ended.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of
the Trust's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.</p>
  <p align="justify">We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>
  <p align="justify">In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies<br>
March 31, 2003 and 2002</H4>

<H4>NATURE OF OPERATIONS</H4>

<p align="justify">Church Loans &amp;  Investments Trust (Church Loans) is a real estate investment
trust that  invests  primarily  in mortgage  and interim  construction  loans to
churches and other borrowers (see note 1) across the United States, particularly
in the southern  portion of the United  States.  Church Loans requires that real
estate properties be pledged against loans as security which could be foreclosed
by Church  Loans  should the  borrower  default.  Repayment  of each  borrower's
obligations is generally  expected to be repaid from  contributions  from church
members  or  from  operations  of  the  borrower,  or in  the  case  of  interim
construction loans, by permanent financing provided by Church Loans or others.</p>
<h4>USE OF ESTIMATES</h4>
<p align="justify">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</p>
<h4>CURRENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT</h4>
<p align="justify">Church Loans has historically invested in long-term,
fixed-rate mortgage loans, generally funded by relatively short-term debt
obligations. The volatility of interest rates and increased competition to
attract customers' funds have caused Church Loans' liability structure to become
short-term and rate sensitive. Church Loans reflected an average interest yield
on its loan and church bond portfolio, an average interest rate on its total
indebtedness and a net interest rate margin at March 31, 2003 and 2002 as
follows: </p>

                    ---------------     ------------      ------------
March 31, 2003           7.80%              3.25%             4.55%
March 31, 2002           9.14%              3.75%             5.39%

</PRE>

<p align="justify">Church Loans finances maturities of debt obligations through its available lines
of  credit  and  principal   payments  received  on  its  mortgage  and  interim
construction loans.</p>
<h4>CHURCH BONDS</h4>
<p align="justify">Church bonds,  secured by first mortgage liens on church facilities,  are stated
at cost,  as there is no traded market for the bonds and  management  intends to
hold such securities until maturity. </p>

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies<br>
March 31, 2003 and 2002</H4>

<h4>LOANS</h4>
<p align="justify">Loans that Church  Loans has the intent and ability to hold for the  foreseeable
future or until maturity or pay-off  generally are reported at their outstanding
unpaid principal  balances  adjusted for  charge-offs,  the allowance for credit
losses,  and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans.  Interest income is
accrued on the unpaid principal  balance.  Loan origination fees, net of certain
direct  origination  costs,  are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the
related loan yield.</p>
<p align="justify">The accrual of interest is generally discontinued on loans and church bonds more
than 60 days past due  unless  the  credit is well  secured  and in  process  of
collection.  In  all  cases,  loans  and  bonds  are  placed  on nonaccrual  or
charged-off  at an earlier  date if  collection  of  principal  or  interest  is
considered doubtful.</p>
<p align="justify">All interest  accrued but not  collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual
or charged-off is reversed against interest income.  The interest on these loans
is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for
return to accrual.  Loans are returned to accrual  status when all the principal
and interest amounts  contractually  due are brought current and future payments
are reasonably assured.</p>
<p align="justify">Commitment fees received on interim  construction  loans are recognized over the
interim commitment period for loans that are not permanently  financed by Church
Loans  and over the life of the  mortgage  loan for loans  that are  permanently
financed by Church Loans.  Amounts are being amortized  using the  straight-line
method.  This method was not  materially  different from the method of deferring
commitment fees until the commitment is exercised and  recognizing  such fees as
an adjustment to yield by the interest  method over the related  loans' lives as
prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles for the years ended March
31, 2003 and 2002.</p>
<p>Purchase discounts on loans are amortized based on the interest method.</p>
<h4>ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES</h4>
<p align="justify">The allowance for credit losses is  established  as losses are estimated to have
occurred through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings.  Loan losses
are   charged   against  the   allowance   when  Church   Loans   believes   the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed.  Subsequent recoveries, if any,
are credited to the allowance.</p>
<p align="justify">The  allowance for credit losses is evaluated on a regular basis by Church Loans
and is based upon management's and the board of trust managers'  periodic review
of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature
and  volume  of the loan  portfolio,  adverse  situations  that may  affect  the
borrower's  ability to repay,  estimated value of any underlying  collateral and
prevailing economic conditions.  This evaluation is inherently  subjective as it
requires  estimates  that  are  susceptible  to  significant  revision  as  more
information becomes available. </p>

<h4>ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (CONTINUED)</h4>
<p align="justify">A loan is considered  impaired when, based on current information and events, it
is probable that Church Loans will be unable to collect the  scheduled  payments
of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan
agreement.  Factors considered by Church Loans in determining impairment include
payment status,  collateral  value, and the probability of collecting  scheduled
principal and interest  payments when due. Loans that  experience  insignificant
payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired.</p>
<p align="justify">Church  Loans   determines  the  significance  of  payment  delays  and  payment
shortfalls  on a  case-by-case  basis,  taking  into  consideration  all  of the
circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the
delay, the reasons for the delay,  the borrower's prior payment record,  and the
amount  of the  shortfall  in  relation  to the  principal  and  interest  owed.
Impairment  is measured on a  loan-by-loan  basis by either the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the
loan's  obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan
is collateral dependent.</p>
<h4>PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT</h4>
<p align="justify">Property  and  equipment  are  stated at cost,  less  accumulated  depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on the  straight-line  method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets.</p>
<h4>OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED</h4>
<p align="justify">Real estate acquired through,  or in lieu of, loan foreclosure is to be sold and
is  initially   recorded  at  estimated  fair  value  at  date  of  foreclosure,
establishing a new cost basis. Other real estate owned,  after  foreclosure,  is
carried at the lower of carrying  amount or the property's  estimated fair value
minus  estimated costs to sell (fair value).  Impairment  losses are measured as
the amount by which the  carrying  amount of a property  exceeds its fair value,
and losses are charged to operations.</p>
<h4>INCOME TAXES</h4>
<p align="justify">Deferred  tax  assets  and   liabilities  are  recognized  for  the  future  tax
consequences   attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial  statement
carrying  amounts of existing assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax
bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected  to apply to  taxable  income  in the  years in which  those  temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax
assets and  liabilities  of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. </p>

credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when
they become payable.</p>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<br>
March 31, 2003 and 2002</H4>

<H4>NOTE 1 - LOANS AND CHURCH BONDS</H4>

<p align="justify">Mortgage loans  receivable  consist of  conventional  loans of  $38,434,079  and
$30,640,302  and church  bonds of  $621,132  and  $751,809 at March 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Interim construction loans of $15,717,226 and $15,760,519 at
March 31, 2003 and 2002,  respectively,  consist  primarily of loans to churches
for the construction of church facilities and assisted living centers.  Mortgage
loans,  church bonds and interim  construction  loans are  generally  secured by
first liens on real estate  comprised  primarily of church  buildings  and other
real  estate.  The  amount of a loan is  generally  limited  to  66-2/3%  of the
appraised  value of the  related  property.  Certain  loans  are  guaranteed  by
individual  members of the  congregations or other individuals or congregations,
depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p align="justify">Church  Loans'  portfolio  included  mortgage  loans,  church  bonds and interim
construction  loans with interest rates ranging from 4.75% to 12.0% at March 31,
2003.  The weighted  average  annual  interest  rates of Church  Loans' loan and
church  bond  portfolio  were  7.80%  and  9.14% at  March  31,  2003 and  2002,
respectively.</p>
<p align="justify">In addition to a concentration of loans to churches,  Church Loans makes certain
interim real estate  construction  loans and permanent  loans to entities  other
than  churches.  At March 31, 2003 and 2002,  Church Loans had five loans to two
borrowers   which  were   secured  by  assisted   living   centers  and  totaled
approximately $7,961,000 and $8,042,000, respectively.</p>

<H4>NOTE 2 - DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CONTINUED)</H4>

Descriptions of the various categories of debt obligations follow:<h4>LINE OF CREDIT PAYABLE TO BANK</h4>
<p align="justify">The line of credit payable to bank consists of borrowings under a loan agreement
effective  through  December 30, 2003,  that provides for a $24,000,000  line of
credit with certain commitment fees. The loan agreement requires Church Loans to
pledge  mortgage  loans  receivable  having  unpaid  principal  balances with an
aggregate  present  value,  discounted at 2% over the prime rate (6.25% at March
31, 2003), of not less than 110% of all indebtedness owed to the bank.  Interest
accrued at the prime rate less one percent on  $20,000,000  and prime less three
quarters  of one  percent  on the  remaining  $4,000,000.  Interest  is  payable
semiannually.</p>
<p align="justify">Additionally,  the line of credit  requires  that Church  Loans' net worth be no
less than  $18,000,000 and its total  indebtedness  shall not exceed 200% of its
net worth. At March 31, 2003, Church Loans' total indebtedness was approximately
$10,000,000 less than the maximum amount permitted under the agreement.</p>
<p align="justify">As of April 14, 2003, Church Loans modified its agreement with the bank. The new
agreement  increases the available  line of credit to  $35,000,000  and requires
that Church Loans' total indebtedness not exceed 250% of its net worth.</p>
<h4>Demand Notes Payable</h4>
<p align="justify">The demand notes  payable bear  interest at 1% less than the prime rate (payable
monthly) and are unsecured (see note 6).</p>
<h4>NOTE 3 - INCOME TAX PROVISION</h4>
<p align="justify">Church Loans has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a real estate  investment
trust under the Code, Church Loans must, among other things, distribute at least
90% of its taxable income to its shareholders through dividends. Church Loans is
required to pay  dividends  of at least 85% of its calendar  year  undistributed
income by subsequent February 1 or be subject to a special federal excise tax of
4% on the undistributed amount. </p>

<h4>NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES</h4>
<p align="justify">Church Loans is a party to financial instruments with  off-balance-sheet risk in
the normal course of business.  Commitments  to extend credit are  agreements to
lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established
in the contract.  Commitments  generally  have variable  interest  rates,  fixed
expiration  dates or other  termination  clauses and  require  payment of a fee.
Since some of the  commitments  may expire  without being drawn upon,  the total
commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Church
Loans  evaluates each  customer's  credit  worthiness on a  case-by-case  basis.
Collateral  generally  includes real estate  properties.  The exposure to credit
loss in the event of  nonperformance  by the other party to the  commitments  to
extend  credit is  represented  by the  contractual  amount.  At March 31, 2003,
Church  Loans  had  outstanding  loan  commitments  (by  contract   amounts)  of
approximately $8,300,000.  Management does not anticipate any losses as a result
of these transactions.</p>
<p align="justify">Church Loans is involved in  litigation in the normal course of business and, in
the opinion of  management,  such  litigation  will have no  material  effect on
Church Loans' financial statements. </p>

<H4>NOTE 9 - DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</H4>

<p align="justify">The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial  instruments,  the results of applying  such methods and
assumptions to the financial  instruments and limitations inherent in fair value
estimates:</p>
<h4>Cash and Cash Equivalents</h4>
<p>The assets are considered  short-term  instruments for which the carrying amount
is a reasonable estimate of fair value.</p>
<h4>Loans and Church Bonds</h4>
<p align="justify">Fair  values  are  estimated  for  portfolios  of loans with  similar  financial
characteristics.  Loans are  segregated  by type,  such as mortgage  and interim
construction  loans and church bonds.  Each loan  category is further  segmented
into  fixed  and  adjustable  rate  interest  terms.  For  variable-rate  loans,
primarily  interim  construction  loans,  that reprice  frequently  and with no
significant  change in credit risk,  fair values are based on carrying  amounts.
The fair value of fixed-rate  mortgage loans and bonds is generally estimated by
discounting  the future cash flows  through  the  estimated  maturity  using the
current  rates at which  similar  loans would be made to borrowers  with similar
credit  ratings.  The estimate of maturity is based on Church Loans'  historical
experience with repayments for each loan classification,  modified, as required,
by an estimate of the effect of current  economic  and lending  conditions.  The
carrying  value of loans and bonds,  net of the  allowance for credit losses was
$52,463,332  and  $45,228,382  and  the  fair  value  of  loans  and  bonds  was
approximately   $57,060,000   and  $50,600,000  at  March  31,  2003  and  2002,
respectively.</p>
<h4>Notes Payable and Line of Credit</h4>
<p>The fair value of notes payable and the line of credit are equal to the
carrying value as such liabilities are deemed to be short-term borrowings. </p>
<h4>Commitments to Extend Credit</h4>
<p align="justify">Generally, Church Loans enters into commitments to extend
credit at adjustable interest terms. Accordingly, the commitment amount is a
reasonable estimate of fair value.</p>
<h4>Other</h4>
<p>The carrying amounts of notes receivable and accrued interest approximate
fair value. </p>

<H4>NOTE  9  -  DISCLOSURE  ABOUT  THE  FAIR  VALUE  OF  FINANCIAL   INSTRUMENTS
(CONTINUED)</H4>

<H4>Limitations</H4>

<p align="justify">Fair value  estimates  are made at a specific  point in time,  based on relevant
market  information  and  information  about  the  financial  instrument.  These
estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering
for sale at one time Church  Loans'  entire  holdings of a particular  financial
instrument.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of Church Loans'
financial  instruments,  fair value  estimates are based on judgments  regarding
future   expected   loss   experience,   current   economic   conditions,   risk
characteristics  of various  financial  instruments,  and other  factors.  These
estimates  are  subjective  in nature and involve  uncertainties  and matters of
significant  judgment  and,  therefore,  cannot be  determined  with  precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. </p>
