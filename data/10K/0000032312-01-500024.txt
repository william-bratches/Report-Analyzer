                   Independent Auditors' Report



Board of Directors
EMCEE Broadcast Products, Inc.
White Haven, Pennsylvania

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of EMCEE Broadcast Products,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2001 and 2000 and the related consoli-
dated statements of loss, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the years
then ended.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Com-
pany's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EMCEE
Broadcast Products, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2001 and 2000, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

         EMCEE BROADCAST PRODUCTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
               YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 AND 2000

1. Summary of significant accounting policies and significant estimates:

Principles of consolidation:
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EMCEE Broadcast
Products, Inc. and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned (together,
the Company).  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated.

Acquisition:
On April 17, 2000, the Company completed its acquisition of Advanced Broadcast
Systems, Inc. (ABS) for approximately $500,000 in cash.  ABS is a manufacturer
of commercial high and medium power analog and digital television transmitters
for UHF broadcast markets.  This acquisition was completed using the purchase
method of accounting.  In connection with this purchase, the Company incurred
Goodwill in the amount of $272,000.  This amount is being amortized over 15
years.

Revenue recognition:
Revenue from product sales of equipment is recognized at the time of delivery
and after consideration of all the terms and conditions of the customers'
contract (purchase order).  Revenues on installation contracts are recorded on
the basis of the estimated percentage of completion of individual contracts
determined under the cost-to-cost method.  Estimated losses on long-term
contracts are recognized in the period in which a loss becomes apparent.

During 1992, a rural cellular license was sold for $3,100,000.  The initial
payment was $845,000, net of closing costs of $155,000.  The $2,100,000
balance, which bore interest at 7% payable at maturity, was due in December
1996.  None of the deferred payment and the related interest income was
recognized prior to 1997 because of their extended collection period and
because there was not a reasonable basis to evaluate the likelihood of
collection.  On April 3, 1997 the Company collected $2,500,000 and received an
unsecured $500,000 note receivable as settlement of the original note.

The $540,000 note receivable is due and payable upon the occurrence of any one
or more of certain specified events involving the debtor including, but not
limited to, acquisition, merger, bankruptcy, and insolvency.  None of the
specified events relate to the debtor's normal operations.  The $540,000
includes accrued interest calculated at 3%.  The note receivable is fully
reserved because it has no definite collection period and because there is not
a reasonable basis to evaluate the likelihood of collection.

               YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 AND 2000

1. Summary of significant accounting policies and significant estimates
   (continued):

Cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills:
The Company considers cash equivalents to be all highly liquid investments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.  U.S. Treasury
Bills with an original maturity of more than three months are considered to be
investments.  All U.S. Treasury Bills are stated at cost which approximates
market and are considered as available for sale.  All U.S. Treasury Bills not
included as cash equivalents had contracted maturities of at least six months.

Inventories:
Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates
current actual cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market (net realizable
value).

Property, plant and equipment and depreciation:
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is provided on
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Investments:
Investments are accounted for under the equity method if the Company has
ownership of between 20% and 50%.  Investments where the Company's ownership
is less than 20% are accounted for under the cost method.

Advertising:
These expenses are recorded when incurred.  They amounted to $38,000 and
$21,000 for 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Use of estimates and significant estimates:
Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements.
Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the
reported revenues and expenses.

At March 31, 2001 and 2000, a significant portion of the inventory of one of
the Company's products is in excess of the Company's current requirements
based on the recent level of sales.  Management has developed a program to
reduce this inventory to desired levels over the near term and believes no
loss will be incurred on its disposition.  No estimate can be made of a range
of amounts of loss that are reasonably possible should the program not be
successful.

               YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 AND 2000

1. Summary of significant accounting policies and significant estimates
   (continued):

The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $1,347,000. Realization is
dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the
loss carryforwards.  Although realization is not assured, management believes
it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will be real
ized.  The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however,
could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during
the carryforward period are reduced.

Reclassifications:
Certain amounts reported in the 2000 financial statements have been reclassi-
fied to conform with the 2001 presentation.

2. Loss per share:

Basic loss per share is computed by dividing loss applicable to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted loss per share is similar to basic loss per share except that the
weighted average of common shares outstanding is increased to include the
number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the
dilutive potential common shares had been issued.  There were no dilutive
potential common shares in 2001 because the assumed exercise of the options
would be anti-dilutive.

The following table presents the basic and diluted EPS computations:

3. Segment information:

In 2001, the Company has two operating segments which manufacture and sell a
variety of products: EMCEE and ABS.  EMCEE manufactures principally multichan-
nel multipoint distribution service (MMDS).  ABS manufactures medium to high
power transmitters.  In 2000, the Company's primary activity was in one
segment which consisted primarily of the manufacturing of MMDS.  The following
is a summary of certain financial information relating to the two segments:

3. Segment information (continued):

Major customers are those that individually account for more than 10% of the
Company's consolidated revenues.  For the years ended March 31, 2001 and 2000,
one customer with total EMCEE sales of $1,221,000 and $1,122,000,
respectively, qualified as a  major customer.  At March 31, 2001 and 2000, the
major customer accounted for 67% and 72%, respectively, of the Company's
consolidated current accounts receivable.  As of March 31, 2001, the Company
is aggressively pursuing through legal action collection of the amounts
outstanding from the major customer.  These amounts are not supported by
letters of credit.  The Company has a specific reserve for this customer in
the amount of $384,000.  ABS did not have sales to any individual customer
greater than 10% of total revenues.

The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and, when
deemed necessary and when possible, requires deposits and a letter of credit
on foreign sales and deposits on domestic sales.  Historically, the Company's
uncollectible accounts receivable have been immaterial.

Foreign sales amounted to $3,513,000 and $2,962,000 for 2001 and
2000,respectively.  Sales by foreign geographic regions are as follows:

5. Long-term debt:

At March 31, 2001, substantially all of the Company's assets were pledged as
collateral for a line of credit and other indebtedness which totaled approxi-
mately $1,107,041.

The line of credit consisted of advances under a line of credit agreement with
commitments aggregating $2,000,000.  The maximum amount of any month end and
average amount outstanding during the year ended March 31, 2001 were
$1,100,000 and $825,000, respectively.  The average amount outstanding was
computed using total daily borrowings divided by the number of days such
borrowings were outstanding.  The weighted average interest rate during the
year ended March 31, 2001 was 8.26%.

On October 30, 2000, the Company received written notice from its primary
lending institution that its working capital line of credit would not be
renewed.  As a result, the bank made a demand for the entire outstanding
principal balance of the line of credit with all accrued and unpaid interest
and all reimbursable fees and expenses of the bank.  Under the provisions of
the bank's notice, these sums had to be paid on or before November 10, 2000.
The Company is, therefore, in default of such payment.  Because the line of
credit is cross defaulted under the bank's loan documents with other
indebtedness of the Company to the bank, the bank had the right to accelerate
the maturity of such other indebtedness and, if not timely paid, hold the
Company in default.  Subsequent to the written notice,  the Company and the
bank entered into a forbearance agreement under which, among other things, the
bank agreed to forbear from exercising its rights and remedies under the loan
documents and permit the Company to repay the line of credit during a specific
period of time and maintain scheduled payments on the other bank debt with
final payment being made in June 2001.

Subsequent to March 31, 2001, this indebtedness was refinanced with $1,500,000
and $500,000 term loans.  The notes mature in 2016 and 2006, and require
monthly payments of $15,214 and $10,379, respectively.  Interest is calculated
at 9% for the $500,000 term loan and 2.0% above the national prime rate for
the $1,500,000 term loan.  The interest rate of the $1,500,000 note adjusts
every three years.  These loans are collateralized by principally all assets
of the Company and contain certain financial and restrictive covenants.  In
addition, both loans contain prepayment penalties.

                                          ==============================

The investments are in companies who own and/or operate businesses that
provides rapid access to the internet, wireless cable television, and other
types of telecommunication service.

Notes receivable of $116,000 were settled in 2001 by the transfer to the
Company of an additional equity investment.  This addition resulted in a
transfer of $346,000 (including the $116,000) from a cost method to equity
method investment.

9. Fair value of financial instruments:

Many of the Company's financial instruments lack an available trading market
as characterized by a willing buyer and a willing seller engaging in an
exchange transaction.  The Company's fair value estimates for those instru-
ments are based upon subjective assumptions and involve significant uncertain-
ties resulting in estimates that vary with changes in assumptions.  Any
changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect
on the estimated fair values disclosed.

Short-term asset and liabilities (exclusive of bank debt):
The fair values of cash and equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, accounts and tax
refund receivables, accounts payable and other short-term financial liabili-
ties approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these
financial instruments.

Other long-term assets:
Fair value of long-term accounts receivable is estimated to approximate
carrying value.  Fair value of cost method investment in 2000 is not disclosed
because it was not practicable to estimate those values

Notes receivables:
The carrying value of notes receivable included in other assets is estimated
to approximate fair values.  Although there are no quoted market prices
available for these instruments, the fair value estimates were based on the
change in interest rate and risk related interest rate spreads since the notes
origination date.  It was not practicable to estimate the fair value of the
note receivable, sale of license, because the Company was unable to estimate
the timing and form of the ultimate settlement of the amount due to it.  The
Company has fully provided for any potential loss resulting from the non-
payment of this receivable.

Debt:
The fair value of debt that is variable rate debt that reprices regularly or
was refinanced subsequent to year end at principal amounts using comparable
interest rate methodology approximates the carrying amounts.
