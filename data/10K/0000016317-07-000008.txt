ITEM 1.  Business

  Registrant was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on July
12, 1922, under the name of California Copper Corporation, as a holding company
for the shares of its operating company, Engels Copper Mining Company which was
incorporated under the laws of the State of California on June 19, 1901.
Engels Copper Mining Company was merged into California Copper Corporation on
March 3, 1936, and the name of the merged company was changed to California-
Engels Mining Company.  Exploration and development commenced at the Engels
Mine, Lights Creek Mining District, Plumas County, California, upon
organization of Engels Copper Mining Company; but it was not until 1914 when the
first all flotation mill for copper in the United States was built and actual
production of copper started.  From 1914 until operations were suspended due to
the low price of copper in July, 1930, approximately 4,700,000 tons of ore were
mined from the Engels and Superior mines and milled producing 160,170,000 pounds
of copper and substantial values in gold and silver.  Out of profits of this
operation, the Registrant retired a bond issue of $500,000 and paid out more
than $1,285,000 in dividends.  During the 1930's the mining and milling plant,
Engelmine townsite and the Indian Valley Railroad subsidiary were dismantled and
sold.

  Registrants mining properties were continuously leased from September, 1947,
to March, 1951; from March, 1951, to December, 1959; from November, 1960, to
October, 1979; from August, 1980, to August, 1990; and from November, 1990, to
April 1993.  The lessee from 1964 to 1993 was Placer Dome U.S. Inc., the U.S.
subsidiary of Placer Dome Inc., Vancouver, B.C., Canada.  The Mining Lease With
Option to Purchase, between the Registrant (Lessor) and Placer Dome U.S. Inc.
(Lessee) was terminated by Placer Dome U.S. Inc. effective April 20, 1993.
Registrant has received a substantial amount of technical data on its mining
properties and maintains a library on the Plumas Copper Belt.

  During the 1960's and 1970's Placer Dome U.S. Inc. conducted an exploration
and development program on Registrants Superior Mine, Sulphide Ridge property
and Engels Mine. They identified two large porphyry-type copper bearing zones
in the Superior Mine and on Sulphide Ridge. The Engels Mine was also estimated
to contain copper mineralization amenable to bulk mining method.  Both the
Engels and Superior mines contain high grade underground copper mineralization.
Other exploration targets remain to be tested including an intensely sheared
area in the quartz monzonite southeast of the Superior Mine and north of
Superior Ridge, the Quigley Prospect, the area between the Superior and Engels
mines in the quartz monzonite near its contact with the coarse grained granite,
along the main fault zone and the metavolcanic, quartz diorite, gabbro contact
northeast of the Engels Mine and an indicated quartz monzonite intrusive beneath
the Engels Mine where a deep ore system could be found. These deposits and
prospects were not deemed economically attractive for many years. However in
response to a projected global shortage of copper and higher prices, interest
has renewed in the geologically unique Lights Creek Mining District.

  On April 18, 2006, Registrant entered into an Exploration Permit With Option
To Lease and Purchase agreement with American Sheffield Inc., a Nevada
corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sheffield Resources Ltd., A British
Columbia corporation, on its 36 patented lode mining claims and 162.12 acres of
fee lands at Engelmine, Lights Creek Mining District, Plumas County, California.
Subsequently on August 10, 2006, American Sheffield Inc. exercised its option to
enter into the Lease and Purchase agreement.  The Lease and Purchase agreement
call for annual payments of $20,000 and the issuance of up to 250,000 shares of
Sheffield Resources Ltd.  Other clauses customary to mining leases are included
in the agreement.  To exercise its option to purchase the above Registrants
property, American Sheffield Inc. may pay either 1,000,000 shares of Sheffield
Resources Ltd. or $10,000,000.  Registrant to receive an annual advance royalty
payment of $60,000 subject to CPI adjustments or two percent (2%) of Net Smelter
Returns, which ever is greater.  Net Smelter Return royalties are capped at
$25,000,000.  Registrant retains the right to the timber on its above property
and to manage its Engelmine Forest, California Tree Farm #2611 pursuant to its
Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan and to extract road rock from the No. 10
Level dump of the Engels Mine.  After mining and reclamation has been completed
on the above property Registrant may request to have title to the lands
transferred back to Registrant.

  A Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan on Registrants mining properties
was approved by the California Department of Forestry and became effective
July 2, 1999.  The permitting process for this project began in August, 1994
with the start of the archaeological survey and the February, 1995 agreement
with Shasta Land Management Consultants to prepare the Plan.

  The Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan is an assessment of the timber
inventory, conditions and potential of the entire property broken down into
units with similar growing conditions within each unit.  Its intent is to
demonstrate a long-term commitment to appropriately manage the resource.  It
functions as a coordinated collection of individual Timber Harvest Plans and
its advantage is that, once approved, the paperwork necessary to initiate
individual timber harvests is minimal.  Under the Plan Registrant is
restricted in management options to those silvicultural systems that produce
uneven-aged stands of timber.  Uneven-aged management means the management of
a specific forest with the goal of establishing a well-stocked stand of various
age classes of trees scattered over the forest.  It will permit the periodic
harvest of all size classes as individual or small groups to realize yield.
Over the long term, forest growth and yield will be balanced.  The Registrant
will also have the advantage of being able to time harvests for favorable
market conditions.  It will take a number of years to fully implement the Plan.

  Registrant made application to the California Tree Farm Committee of the
American Tree Farm System for approval of its Engelmine Forest timber lands on
Lights Creek as a tree farm.  Its Engelmine Forest was accepted as California
Tree Farm No. 2611 on June 17, 1999.

  From 1999 to 2001 Registrant engaged in mechanical thinning and timber harvest
projects on its properties producing 1,809,520 board feet of timber.  Hand
thinning projects are ongoing on overstock areas of Registrants property.  The
purpose of the thinning harvests is to reduce fire danger, improve the timber
stand, provide wildlife protection, remove hazard timber and improve aesthetics.

  The U.S.D.A. Forest Service approved its Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment
on January 21, 2004 and affirmed it after appeals on November 18, 2004.  The
plan will activate the Herger-Feinstein Quincy Library Group (HFQLG) pilot
project on the Plumas National Forest.  If the HFQLG is implemented it will
result in surface ladder fuels thinning to reduce the extent and severity of
wildland fires in the Plumas National Forest surrounding Registrants
property

  Registrant is subject to a State of California General Industrial Activities
Storm Water Permit.  During the year, pursuant to the Registrants Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan, catch and evaporation basins and monthly water
sampling records were maintained.


ITEM 2.  Properties

      (a)  Registrant is the fee owner of 36 patented lode mining claims
totaling 736 acres, plus 239.24 acres of other patented lands at Engelmine,
Lights Creek Mining District, Plumas County, California. Pursuant to the
Exploration permit With Option to Lease and Purchase dated April 18, 2006,
American Sheffield Inc., a Nevada Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Sheffield Resources Ltd., a British Columbia corporation, exercised its option
to enter into a Mining Lease with Option to Purchase Registrants 36 patented
lode mining claims and 162.12 acres of other patented lands at Engelmine.

  The remaining 77.12 acres of Registrants patented lands at Engelmine are not
subject to any encumbrance.

      (b)  Registrant is the fee owner of five patented lode mining claims
totaling 100 acres in the Genesee Mining District, Plumas County, California.
None of the claims are subject to any encumbrance.

         Shareholder Matters

      (a)  Principal Markets.

  Registrant's shares of Capital Stock are quoted on the Over-the-Counter
Market in the "pink sheets" which are published daily by the Pink Sheets LLC
under the symbol "CAEN".

  The following table shows the high and low bid prices of Registrant's Capital

     (b)  Approximate number of holders of capital stock.
  The approximate number of holders of record of Registrants Capital Stock as
of March 19, 2007 is 776.

     (c)  Registrant has not paid a dividend on its Capital Stock because it
has had an accumulated deficit since the merger in 1936.  Prior to the current
Lease and Purchase agreement the Board of Directors of the Registrant endeavored
to earn income from the sale of timber, sale of land, sale of sand and rock and
its bookkeeping business so funds were available for the maintenance of its
mining properties and the implementation of its timber management plan.  It is
not the intention of the Registrant to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.

ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

      (a)  Financial condition, changes in financial condition and results
of operations.

  During the 30 years its mining properties were leased, the Board of
Directors of the Registrant endeavored to increase working capital, total
assets and shareholder's equity in the event that its lessee, Placer Dome U.S.
Inc., terminated its Mining Lease With Option to Purchase agreement and return
the mining properties to the Registrant.  This event occurred effective April
20, 1993.  Thus funds were available to begin preparation of the Non-Industrial
Timber Management Plan.  Because timber and land sale revenues are infrequent,
in order to provide regular monthly income the President of the Registrant, on
January 1, 2000, transferred his bookkeeping business to the Registrant.
The current Lease and Purchase agreement will provide additional funds for
operation.  Changes in working capital, total assets and shareholders equity
for the past five years are summarized as follows:

                                   2006     2005     2004     2003     2002
                                   ----     ----     ----     ----     ----
       Changes in
       Working Capital ($)         25,051   47,751   35,052   19,798   79,248
       Total Assets               519,271  505,099  453,175  460,901  545,840
       Shareholder's Equity       501,950  482,215  428,441  430,477  448,277

  The objective of the Board of Directors of the Registrant is to earn income
from the Lease and Purchase agreement, the sale of timber, sale of land, sale of
sand and rock, and its bookkeeping business so funds are available for the
maintenance of its mining properties and the implementation of its Non-
Industrial Timber Management Plan.

      (b)  Results of operations.

  Registrants principal sources of income are from the Lease and Purchase
Agreement, sale of timber, sale of land, sale of sand and rock, bookkeeping
business, interest and dividends.  There is no assurance that any of the sources
of income will continue at current rates into the future.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  This summary of significant accounting policies of California-Engels Mining
Company (the Company) is presented to assist in understanding the Company's
financial statements.  The financial statements and notes are representations
of the Company's management who is responsible for their integrity and
objectivity.  These accounting policies conform to Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles and have been consistently applied in the preparation of
the financial statements.

Nature of Activity

  The Company's principal line of business is development of mineral and timber
properties.  The principal revenue sources currently consist of timber, land
and rock sales, and investment and rental income. The Company's properties are
located in the western United States.

Estimates

  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures.  Accordingly, actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Basis of Accounting

  The Company's books are maintained on the accrual method of accounting.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

  For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid debt instruments with a purchased maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.

Concentration of Credit Risk

  The Company places its temporary cash investments with financial
institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial
institution.

Mineral and Timber Lands

  Mineral and timber lands and depreciable property are stated at book value
less accumulated depletion and depreciation.  Depreciation is calculated using
the declining balance method over five to seven years.  Timber depletion is
calculated based on units of production.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2006
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 4 - VALUATION OF MINERAL LANDS - DEFERRED INCOME TAXES

  The Mineral lands carried on the books at a value of $10,000 less depletion
have a historical cost basis from June 19, 1901 of $1,000,000.  Beginning in
1913, different valuations were placed on these lands by the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue.  Under instructions of the Commissioner, the values of the
land were written up on the books to a high of $4,500,000 on February 23, 1928.

  In 1934, because of depressed conditions, the mineral lands were written
down to $10,000 without any tax benefit.  In the event of a sale of these lands
the recognized gain for tax purposes will be substantially reduced or
eliminated.  Consequently a deferred tax asset of approximately $340,000 has
been offset by a corresponding valuation allowance of approximately $340,000
due to the unlikelihood of the sale of the property in the near future.

  It is estimated that the current market value of the properties meets or
exceeds the $1,000,000 historical cost basis; however, due to the length of
time the Company has reported the land values at the written down value of
$10,000, a change to the cost method has not been deemed appropriate for
reporting purposes.

cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to
maturity.  Realized gains and losses are determined using specific
