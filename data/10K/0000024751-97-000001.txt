                         CORNING NATURAL GAS CORPORATION
                                   FORM 10-KSB
                 For the 9 Month Period Ended September 30, 1996


                                     Part I

ITEM 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
(a)  Business Development
Corning Natural Gas Corporation (the "Company" or "Registrant"), incorporated in
1904, is a natural gas utility.  The Company purchases its entire supply of gas,
and distributes it through its own pipeline distribution and transmission
systems to residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers in the
Corning, New York area and to two other gas utilities which service the Elmira
and Bath, New York areas.  The Company is under the jurisdiction of the Public
Service Commission of New York State which oversees and sets rates for New York
gas distribution companies.  The Company also sells, leases and services
appliances, primarily gas burning, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Corning
Natural Gas Appliance Corporation.
(b)  Business of Issuer
     (1)  The Company maintains a gas supply portfolio of numerous contracts and
is not dependent on a single supplier.  Additionally, the Company has
capabilities for storing 793,000 Mcf through storage operations with two of its
suppliers.  The Company had no curtailments during 1996 and expects to have an
adequate supply available for its customers during 1997 providing that no
abnormal conditions or actions occur.
     (2)  The Company is franchised to supply gas service in all the political
subdivisions in which it operates and is adequately protected therewith.
     (3)  Since the Company's business is seasonal by quarters, sales for each
quarter of the year vary and are not comparable.  Sales for different periods
vary depending on variations in temperature, but the Company's Weather
Normalization Clause (WNC) serves to stabilize net revenue from the effects of
temperature variations. The WNC allows the Company to adjust customer billings
to compensate for fluctuations in net revenue caused by temperatures which are
higher or lower than the thirty year average temperature for the period.  Degree
days, which represent the number of degrees that the average daily temperature
falls below 65 degrees Fahrenheit, totaled 4,577 for the period January 1
through September 30, 1996 and 4,273 for the same period in 1995.
     (4)  The Company has three major customers, Corning Incorporated, New York
State Electric & Gas (NYSEG), and Bath Electric, Gas & Water Systems (BEGWS).
The loss of any of these customers could have a significant impact on the
Company's financial results.
     (5)  Historically, the Company's competition in the residential market has
been primarily from electricity in cooking, water heating and clothes drying,
and to a very small degree, in heating.  The price of gas remains low in
comparison to that of electricity in the Company's service territory and the
Company's competitive position in the residential market continues to be very
strong.  Approximately 99% of the Company's general service customers heat with
gas.
     In recent years competition from oil has developed in the industrial
market.  The Company has been able to counteract much of this competition, to
date, through the transportation of customer owned gas for a transportation
charge.  The customer arranges for their own gas supply, then moves it through
the Company's facilities for a transportation fee.   The Company's
transportation rate is equal to the lowest unit rate of the appropriate rate
classification, exclusive of gas costs, hence the profit margin is maintained.
Additionally, under the recent deregulated environment there is opportunity for
the Company to increase revenue by selling its upstream pipeline capacity to
transportation customers.  The Company is authorized to retain 15% of such
revenue and 85% is returned to firm customers in the form of lower gas costs.
Transportation customers that pay for this capacity are virtually assured that
their supply will not be interrupted.  Revenues derived from the resale of this
capacity were $131,953 for 9 months ended September 30, 1996 and $104,294 for
the period January 1 through September 30, 1995. 
     For those willing to bear some risk, the Company has an interruptible
transportation rate for its large industrial customers whereby the customer may
elect to avoid payment of demand charges but bears the risk of partial or total
upstream interruption of service during certain periods.  To maintain industrial
load in the event that oil prices temporarily drop below the equivalent gas
price, the Company continues to maintain a flexible transportation rate
schedule.  This flexible rate, however, was not utilized in 1996 and has been
invoked only once since its inception.
     In September 1995 the Company purchased the assets of a local gas
distribution system, Finger Lakes Gas Company, through the Federal Bankruptcy
Court.  Finger Lakes Gas served customers in the Hammondsport, NY area and had a
customer base of approximately 320 customers.  The Company was able to purchase
this all plastic system with a bid of $560,000.  The Company was pleased to
purchase these assets that originally cost over $1.5 million to construct for
its relatively low bid.  The nearly new, all plastic, system was already
connected and serving 320 customers with a potential to add 200 more in the near
future.  On a per customer basis, this represents a very low investment.  The
capital to purchase these assets was obtained through short term debt.  The
Company has not found it necessary to apply for an increase in rates on this
part of our system which means the original rates made effective in 1990 remain
in effect six years later.
     Shortly after the Company took possession of the system, Mercury Aircraft,
Inc. announced it would purchase the former Taylor Wine Company facilities and
centralize their other plants.  The reopening of this major facility will most
certainly contribute toward the stability and future viability of the new gas
system which is now part of the Company.  The former Finger Lakes Gas Company's
operations, did not have a significant impact on 1995, but contributed in excess
of $150,000 to gross margin (revenues less gas cost) for the period ended
September 30, 1996.
     In December, 1994 the New York Public Service Commission instituted a
proceeding to address issues related to the merging competitive natural gas
market.  This proceeding is intended to provide a framework whereby access to
facilities on upstream pipelines made available by FERC Order 636 would be
available to end use customers on the Local Distribution Company level.  New
tariff filings were approved and became effective September 1, 1996.  The
Company considers this a transitional step towards full unbundling of services
with future changes made as circumstances warrant.
     The Company received approval for a rate increase from the New York State
Public Service Commission of approximately $124,000 in revenues with an
effective date of September 1, 1996.
     (6)  The Company believes compliance with present federal, state and local
provisions relating to the protection of the environment will not have any
material adverse effect on capital expenditures, earnings and financial position
of the Company and its subsidiary.
     (7)  Sixty-seven persons were employed on a full-time basis and six on a
part-time basis by the Company in 1996 and 1995.     
     (8)  The Company's labor-management relationship is good.  Typical labor
negotiations are completed in one to two days.  The current labor contract was
signed September 1, 1995 for a three year period.
ITEM 2 - DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
     The Company completed the construction of a new office building at 330 West
William Street, Corning, NY in the fall of 1991.  This structure is physically
connected to the operations center built three years earlier.  The Company had
outgrown its general offices at 27 East Denison Parkway.  The property has been
sold, and the gain on the sale was returned to ratepayers in previous years.
     The Company's pipeline system is thoroughly surveyed each year.  Any
necessary replacements are included in the construction budget.  Approximately
105 miles of transmission main, 279 miles of distribution main, 13,800 services
and 86 measuring and regulating stations, along with various other property are
distributed throughout the service area.  All of the above described property is
owned by the Company, except for approximately one mile of 10" gas main which is
under a long-term lease and is used primarily to serve Corning Incorporated.
All of the above described property which is owned by the Company is adequately
insured, and is subject to the lien of the Company's first mortgage indenture.
ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
     The Company is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings, nor
is the Company aware of any problems of any consequence which it anticipates may
result in legal proceedings.

ITEM 4 - SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
     No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the third
quarter of 1996.

               CORNING NATURAL GAS CORPORATION 1996 ANNUAL REPORT

Report to Shareholders

     A variety of circumstances and opportunities have culminated in the
production of above average financial results for the first three quarters of
1996 as well as for the past twelve months.  We will be discussing the first
nine months of the year in addition to twelve month results as we have moved
from a December 31 to a September 30 fiscal year.  This change, which will end
our year during a mild season, actually provides a more realistic annual picture
of the financial results of the highly seasonal business nature that is typical
for northeastern natural gas distribution companies.  The numbers presented to
you throughout this report are audited for the nine month period ended September
30, 1996 but are unaudited for the nine months and twelve months ended September
30, 1995.

     FINANCIAL RESULTS - As previously stated, a number of factors combined in
providing outstanding results for the past year.  On an individual basis, no
particular segment of our business was outstanding except perhaps for overall
gas deliveries.  Rather exceptionally cold weather, which produced 7.5 percent
more degree days than the fifteen year average, did result in 779,000 Mcf more
deliveries in the twelve months ended September 30, 1996 than the prior year.
Consolidated earnings of $483,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 1996,
and $795,000 for the twelve month period ended September 30, 1996 resulted in an
increase over the prior period of 56 percent and 37 percent respectively.
Incremental revenues derived from non-traditional sources provided as a result
of the restructuring process referred to elsewhere in this report account for
some of the earnings improvement.  The purchase of the Hammondsport, NY gas
delivery system generated gross margin of $150,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 1996.  The physical acquisition was made without difficulty while
sales generated were higher than projections with relatively low operating
costs.  The Company's Appliance subsidiary also contributed significantly, once
again, to our consolidated results. 

     APPLIANCE SUBSIDIARY - The Company's wholly owned subsidiary also continued
to improve its contributions to earnings.  For the nine months ended September
30, 1996 the Appliance Corporation earned $132,000, an improvement of 24 percent
over the same period of 1995.  Twelve month earnings, ended September 30, 1996,
of $229,000 are 19 percent ahead of the prior year and amount to 29 percent of
our 12 month consolidated results.  The Company operates three retail stores
including one in Elmira, Bath and Corning.  We recently moved the Elmira store
into a complex of shops adjacent to the new, impressive Wegman's supermarket
near downtown Elmira.  Eleven burning natural gas fireplace displays were
installed at this store as its primary feature.  We expect to vastly improve the
traffic at this new outlet which opened October 1, 1996 as the Wegmans plaza is
projected to eventually attract up to 50,000 customers per week.  Both the
Corning and Bath outlets were remerchandised at the same time to capitalize on
the opening of the Elmira unit.  We look forward to a promising future for the
Appliance Subsidiary as its growth and contribution to consolidated results play
an ever increasing role.

     ACQUISITION - The purchase of the Hammondsport, NY, distribution system
(previously operated by the Finger Lakes Gas Company) has exceeded forecast
expectations.  We have achieved moderate results in adding new customers on the
system which was approximately sixty percent saturated when we purchased it in
bankruptcy court.  However, projected results were enhanced when the single
largest customer was placed on stream very shortly after we purchased the system
in September, 1995.  This customer, Mercury Aircraft, Inc., accounts for a
significant proportion of system deliveries in Hammondsport.  The additional
revenues generated by this customer have enabled us to provide continued service
throughout Hammondsport without any rate adjustments.  While the rates that we
deliver natural gas to customers in Hammondsport are similar to those in
Corning, there has been no rate increase on this system since its original
construction in 1990.

     MAJOR CUSTOMERS - The Company has continued its relationships with its
primary industrial and wholesale customers.  We provide primarily gas
transportation services to our wholesale accounts in Elmira and Bath which
amounted to 37 percent of total throughput for the year ending September 30,
1996 which represents an increase of 13 percent.  We also maintain excellent
relationships with our large industrial users, Corning Incorporated, Pollio
Dairy and Dresser Rand.  We recently executed a contract with Corning
Incorporated wherein the Company will provide the main plant facilities (intown)
with all of their requirements either through sales, transportation, and/or
storage services for the next three years with potential renewals extending to
five years.  Such contracts and relationships help us to stabilize our overall
throughput and earnings into the  future.  The Company currently transports
nearly one hundred percent of the natural gas used by all of its industrial and
wholesale customers and many of its large commercial and municipal accounts.
Transportation services now account for approximately two thirds of our total
gas deliveries.

     RATES - The Company had filed a rate application with the NYSPSC in the
amount of $368,000 on June 8, 1995 with a requested implementation date of
January 1, 1996.  Unfortunately, a series of delays and adjustments resulted in
a final approval of only $124,000 which did not become effective until September
1, 1996.  Thus, this rate adjustment has almost no impact upon earnings as
stated in this report.  We have managed to keep control of our overhead,
particularly when considering that the prior rate increase, which was effective
in November, 1993, amounted to only $88,000.  Therefore, our rates have only
increased a total of $212,000 during the past three years which represents an
increase of only 1.5% to the average residential customer.  Further, any
additional potential increases in our rates will not take place before 1998.

     Another adjustment that affects rates is that the Company chose, in 1992,
to protect its customers and its shareholders from exceptional swings in the
weather by instituting the weather normalization into the billing factor.
Thus, when the winter is colder than average, the Company reduces its billing
factor to residential and commercial customers thereby minimizing excess
earnings or losses as a result of warmer or colder than normal weather.
During the twelve months ended September 30, 1996, the Company returned $201,000
in the form of reduced rates to its retail and commercial customers as a result
of colder than normal weather.  

     Additionally, we previously stated that we were successful in deriving
revenues from non-traditional sources.  The marketing of excess pipeline
capacity on the system benefits both the Company and its customers.  Since the
Company retains only fifteen percent of its capacity assignment sales, our
customers are the beneficiaries of the other eighty-five percent of such sales.
Over the past twelve months we have returned $1,030,000 to our customers through
lower rates as a direct result of these incremental revenues.

     OPERATING EXPENSES AND TAXES - On the positive side, our ability to
maintain a steady rate structure and control our operating expenses helps to
keep gas at affordable prices.  For the twelve months ended September 30, 1996,
our total operating expenses, including depreciation, actually declined by
$78,000 or 2 percent.  Unfortunately, general and federal income taxes rose by
$450,000 or 27 percent during this same period.

     During the past year, our Company collected over $1.8 million in general
taxes from our customers.  Most of these taxes were made up of the much
discussed gross revenue tax (GRT) which is a tax on all revenues charged by
utilities within the state.  Other industries in the state are taxed only upon
their earnings.  There has been a great deal of discussion across the state
regarding the need to reduce energy costs, particularly electric rates, if we
are to attract new industries or even maintain existing industry.  New York
State utility customers pay twice the national average in taxes.  Everyone
recognizes the need to replace the GRT with a more realistic taxing system, but
nothing has yet been accomplished at the state capital in this regard.  Governor
George Pataki's administration has reduced personal income taxes and eliminated
the surtax on businesses and is now discussing a gradual phase-down of the GRT.
The Governor was also successful in reforming workman's compensation laws which
has resulted in a 17 percent savings in this particular expense to our Company. 

     CAPITAL ADDITIONS - The majority of our capital additions are made to
upgrade the pipeline distribution system and to add new customers.  During the
past nine months we replaced 118   service lines, 3,570 feet of mains and added
50 new services.  We have had an ongoing program to replace all outdoor meters
with temperature compensated meters which provides for more accurate measurement
of gas at weather extremes, particularly important during cold weather.  This
program will be completed in 1997.  Nearly 100 percent of all the pipelines and
service lines we have installed since 1970 have been with plastic.  We continue
to carefully monitor the older steel distribution system while installing
corrosion control equipment in the most crucial areas.  In the past three years
we have installed corrosion protection equipment on an additional 29 miles of
mains.  We dedicate three full-time employees for leak detection and corrosion
control.  Each year we also expend a portion of the budget to upgrade the
rolling stock and expand computer utilization.  Our fleet of 30 service and
installation vans, crew trucks, backhoes, special equipment trucks and
automobiles are in excellent condition and replacements are made annually based
upon usage and condition.

     SUMMARY - The local economy remains somewhat stagnant as Corning
Incorporated and Dresser Rand have downsized and done some restructuring over
the past several years.  Corning Natural Gas has, however, made advances through
its purchase of the Hammondsport gas system, sales of pipeline capacity,
expansion of appliance sales in Elmira and through internal cost controls.
Having just ended an excellent year, while positioning ourselves to provide a
variety of services to our customers at highly competitive rates, we feel quite
positive about the future of our industry and our Company.  Twelve month
earnings of $1.74 per share have positioned us to pay an annualized dividend of
$1.28 per share.  The dividend to be paid on February 20, 1997 is the Company's
176th consecutive dividend.  These results could not have been possible without
the commitment of a group of loyal and dedicated employees who strive to upgrade
the quality of their work and expand the services provided to our customers.  We
sincerely thank these employees along with a supportive Board of Directors and
all of the customers that help to make us a service driven organization.

                              For the Board of Directors,

                              Thomas K. Barry
                              Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     During 1996 the Company changed its fiscal year end from December 31 to
September 30.  The Company believes that the September 30 fiscal year end better
represents its natural business cycle.  The adjacent table compares the results
for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 to the unaudited results for the
nine months ended September 30, 1995.  The discussion of operating results will
focus on these periods.

EARNINGS

     Net income in 1996 was $483,000, or $1.05 a share, compared to net income
of $309,000, or $.67 a share in 1995.  The earnings improvement results from the
acquisition of the former Finger Lakes Gas Company which contributed $150,000 to
gross margin (revenue less gas cost), and from revenues derived from non-
traditional sources.  Recent industry restructuring allows the Company to
benefit from such non-traditional sources such as the assignment of unused
pipeline capacity, the sale of natural gas to both on-system and off-system
customers, and the assignment of storage capacity.

     Additionally, unregulated subsidiary earnings improved 24 percent to
$131,900 in 1996, as discussed below.
  
OPERATING REVENUE

     Operating revenue of $15,100,000 increased 24 percent in 1996 due primarily
to an increase in gas cost billings.  The Company's billing rates are adjusted
to reflect changes in gas costs (which include current cost as well as prior
period reconciliation amounts), keeping the effect of such changes earnings
neutral to the Company.  The acquisition of the former Finger Lakes Gas Company
produced an additional $603,000 in revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 1996.

     Total gas delivered to customers increased 10 percent to 6,033,000 Mcf in
1996.  The acquisition of the former Finger Lakes Gas Company added 111,000 Mcf
to the Company's throughput in 1996.  Colder weather also increased throughput
in 1996 but the Company's weather normalization billing mechanism serves to
neutralize the effect of weather.  Accordingly, the Company billed $203,000 less
to customers through this mechanism in 1996, as expected and designed.

                                                         9/30/95

Earnings per common share                 $      1.05 $       .67

OPERATING EXPENSE   

     The Company's most significant element of cost is purchased natural gas.
Purchased gas expense amounted to 68 percent of total operating expenses in 1996
and 63 percent of the total in 1995.  Purchased gas expense increased 34% in
1996 due to increased deliveries noted above, higher prior period gas cost
reconciliation amounts and higher supplier rates.  The Company's average cost of
gas per Mcf was $4.47 in 1996 and $4.21 in 1995.

     Taxes other than income taxes increased $230,000 or 19% primarily due to an
increase in state and local taxes levied on gross revenue.  Other operating and
maintenance expenses did not change significantly. 

UNREGULATED OPERATIONS

     The Appliance Corporation subsidiary earnings improved 24 percent to
$131,900 in 1996.  Increased rental revenues and an improvement in profit
margins resulting from strategic pricing contributed to the boost in subsidiary
earnings. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Capital expenditures amounting to $682,500 in 1996 were financed with
internally generated funds and short-term borrowing.

     Our change in fiscal year end created several significant variations in
balance sheet amounts from December 31, 1995 including accounts receivable,
unrecovered or refundable gas costs and notes payable, as the result of much
milder weather at September 30.  Transition costs deferred and the related
liability decreased significantly as this liability is almost entirely paid by
the Company and collected from its customers.   Gas stored underground at
September 30, 1996 increased significantly from December 31, 1995 due to the
normal operation of storage.  The Company injects gas into storage during the
summer months and withdraws it during the winter months.

     The Company has unsecured bank lines of credit totaling $5,500,000, the
terms of which are disclosed in note 6 to the financial statements.  The Company
continues to explore opportunities to refinance current debt.  Management
believes that the combination of currently available credit facilities and
internally generated funds will provide sufficient financial resources for 1997.

REGULATORY MATTERS

     The Company implemented a rate increase effective September 1, 1996 in the
amount of $124,000.  However, the increase had no material effect on the fiscal
period ended September 30, 1996.  In addition, the Company will continue its
weather normalization clause whereby customer bills are adjusted to reflect
deviations from normal weather patterns.

INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING

     1996 saw the culmination of efforts which began in 1994 to provide the
perceived benefits of competition in the natural gas industry to all classes of
customers, irrespective of size.  Tariffs were filed and approved by the Public
Service Commission (PSC) to give each and every customer the opportunity to
participate in the competitive environment by purchasing gas in the open market
rather than from Corning Natural Gas and by utilizing the storage facilities
leased by the Company.
 
     The Company has also been provided with additional opportunities and
responsibilities through non-traditional sources.  Opportunities exist for the
Company to enhance earnings by assigning unneeded upstream pipeline capacity to
others and by marketing gas to both on-system and off-system customers.  In each
case the Company is allowed to retain 15% of the margin, passing 85% back to
firm customers through rates.  Efforts to assign unneeded capacity have been
quite successful.  Competition in the gas marketing business, however, is very
keen, with thin margins.  

     It will be some time before the success of the restructuring efforts can be
effectively gauged.  For a variety of reasons transportation to small volume
customers has been slow to catch on, both on Corning's system and throughout the
state.  At meetings held with customers and marketers, each group expressed
interest in participating, however, it was generally agreed that the transition
will be gradual.  Within the industry there are a variety of directions being
taken by individual companies, with some companies taking the extreme position
of exiting the merchant function completely and providing only transportation
service.

     This Company has been involved in the entire regulatory process leading up
to the current scheme and will continue to keep abreast of changes which may
evolve.  Since this initiative represents the most sweeping change ever to
impact the industry, it is logical that more change will follow.  Management is
dedicated to not only complying with the regulatory requirements but looking for
every opportunity to prosper in the new environment.

                      And The Year Ended December 31, 1995

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

     Corning Natural Gas Corporation (the Company) is a gas distribution company
     providing gas on a commodity and transportation basis to its customers in
     the Southern Tier of New York State.  The Company follows the Uniform
     System of Accounts prescribed by the Public Service Commission of the State
     of New York (PSC) which has jurisdiction over and sets rates for New York
     State gas distribution companies.  The Company's regulated operations meet
     the criteria and accordingly, follow the accounting and reporting of SFAS
     71 "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation."  The
     Company's financial statements contain the use of estimates and assumptions
     for reporting certain assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and actual
     results could differ from the estimates.  The more significant accounting
     policies are summarized below.

     Principles of Consolidation and Presentation

     The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly
     owned subsidiary, The Corning Natural Gas Appliance Corporation (Appliance
     Corporation).  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
     been eliminated in consolidation.  The results of the Appliance Corporation
     are reported separately as unregulated operations in the consolidated
     statements of income and retained earnings.  Shared expenses are allocated
     to the Appliance Corporation.  It is the Company's policy to reclassify
     amounts in the prior year's financial statements to conform with the
     current year's presentation.

     Utility Plant and Rented Gas Appliances

     Utility plant is stated at the historical cost of construction.  These
     costs include payroll, fringe benefits, materials and supplies and
     transportation costs.  The Company charges normal repairs to maintenance
     expense.  The Appliance Corporation capitalizes the cost of appliances and
     the original installation to rented gas appliances.  Subsequent repairs are
     expensed.

     Depreciation

     The Company provides for depreciation for accounting purposes using a
     composite straight-line method based on the estimated economic lives of
     property.  The depreciation rate used for utility plant, expressed as an
     annual percentage of depreciable property, was 3.3% in 1996 and 1995.  At
     the time utility properties are retired, the original cost plus costs of
     removal less salvage, are charged to accumulated depreciation.  Rented gas
     appliances are depreciated on a straight-line basis ranging from 10% to 20%
     per year.

     Revenue and Natural Gas Purchased

     The Company records revenue from residential and commercial customers based
     on meters read on a cycle basis throughout each month, while certain large
     industrial and utility customers' meters are read through the end of each
     month.  The Company secured a weather normalization clause in the last
     major filing as protection against severe weather fluctuations.  This
     affects space heating customers and is activated when degree days are 2%
     greater or less than a 30 year average.  Hence, the effect on revenue
     fluctuations in weather related gas sales is somewhat neutralized.  Gas
     purchases are recorded based on readings of suppliers' meters as of the end
     of the month.  The Company's rate tariffs include a Gas Adjustment Clause
     (GAC) which adjusts rates to reflect changes in gas costs from levels
     established in the rate setting process.  In order to match such costs and
     revenue, the PSC has provided for an annual reconciliation of recoverable
     GAC costs with applicable revenue billed.  Any excess or deficiency in GAC
     revenue billed is deferred and the balance at the reconciliation date is
     either refunded or recovered from the customers over a subsequent 12-month
     period.

     Federal Income Tax

     The Company uses the asset and liability method to establish deferred tax
     assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial
     reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities
     at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are
     realized or settled.  In addition, such deferred tax assets and liabilities
     will be adjusted for the effects of enacted changes in tax laws and rates.

(2)  Acquisition of Finger Lakes Gas

     On September 20, 1995 the Company acquired the assets associated with the
     distribution system of Finger Lakes Gas Company for $560,000.  The assets
     were purchased at public auction held in Federal Bankruptcy Court.  The
     acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, accordingly, the assets were
     added to utility plant at their purchase price.  The former Finger Lakes
     Gas Company's operations, which did not have a significant impact on 1995,
     are included in the consolidated results from the acquisition date.  Gross
     margin (revenue less gas cost) generated was $150,000 for the nine months
     ended September 30, 1996 and $50,000 for the twelve months ended December
     31, 1995.

     Selected financial information for the Company's identifiable operating
     segments follows:

                  ==========  ==========   =======  =========   =======  =======

     The Company's regulated operations have no significant assets which are
     excluded from recoverability under rate filings.

(4)  Regulatory Matters

     Certain costs are deferred and recognized as expenses when they are
     reflected in rates and recovered from customers as permitted by SFAS 71.
     These costs are shown as Regulatory Assets.  Such costs arise from the
     traditional cost-of-service rate setting approach where all prudently
     incurred costs are recoverable through rates.  Deferral of these costs is
     appropriate while the Company's rates are regulated under a cost-of-service
     approach. 
    
     In a purely competitive environment, such costs might not have been
     incurred or deferred.  Accordingly, if the Company's rate setting were
     changed from a cost-of-service approach and it was no longer allowed to
     defer these costs under SFAS 71, certain of these assets may not be fully
     recoverable.  However, the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, of
     competition and continues to operate in a cost-of-service based regulatory
     environment and therefore believes that accounting under SFAS 71 is still
     appropriate.

     Below is a summarization of the Regulatory Assets as of September 30, 1996
     and December 31, 1995:

                                                        1996            1995

     Unrecovered gas costs - These costs are recoverable over future years and
     arise from an annual reconciliation of certain gas revenue and costs (as
     described in Note 1).

     Deferred transition costs - The Company is currently collecting transition
     costs through the GAC as authorized by the PSC, but final policy may
     require collection from transportation customers as well.

     Deferred debits - accounting for income taxes - This amount represents the
     expected future recovery from ratepayers of the tax consequences of
     temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis
     of assets and liabilities.

     Other deferred debits - The majority of this amount represents timing
     differences between the Company's rate case filings and financial reporting
     period for pension and postretirement benefit accounting.

     The Company expects that its regulatory assets will be fully recoverable
     from customers.

     Actual federal income tax expense differs from the expected federal income
     tax expense (computed by applying the federal corporate tax rate of 34% to
     income before federal income tax expense) as follows:

                                                     1996        1995

     There was no change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets
     during 1996 and 1995.

(8)  Pension Plan

     The Company has defined pension plans covering substantially all of its
     employees.  The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's
     highest average compensation during a specified period.  The Company makes
     annual contributions to the plans equal to amounts determined in accordance
     with the funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Security Act of
     1974.  Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits
     attributed for service to date, but also for those expected to be earned in
     the future.  The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and
     amounts recognized on the Company's balance sheet under Statement of
     Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions"
     (SFAS 87) at September 30, 1996 and December 31, 1995.

     The components of net periodic pension expense under SFAS 87 for the nine
     months ended September 30, 1996 and the year ended December 31, 1995 are as
     follows:

                                                         1996        1995

          Net periodic pension expense               $   33,510      91,386 

     For ratemaking purposes, pension expense represents the amount approved by
     the PSC in the Company's most recently approved rate case.  Pension benefit
     for ratemaking purposes was approximately $45,000 and $60,000 during the
     nine months ended September 30, 1996 and the year ended December 31, 1995,
     respectively.  The difference between the pension expense (benefit) for
     ratemaking purposes and the amount computed under SFAS 87 has been deferred
     and is not included in the prepaid pension cost noted above.

     The assumptions used to determine pension expense obligations and pension
     costs for 1995 and 1996 were 7.25% for weighted average discount rate, 5.0%
     for rate of compensation increase, and 8.0% for weighted average rate of
     return on plan assets.

(9)  Major Customers

     The Company has three major customers, Corning Incorporated, New York State
     Electric & Gas (NYSEG) and Bath Electric Gas & Water Systems (BEGWS).  The
     loss of any of these customers could have a significant impact on the
     Company's financial results.  In addition, a significant portion of
     capacity assignment revenue is generated from Corning Inc.  Total revenue
     and deliveries to these customers were as follows:

                            Mcf         % of                     % of

(10) Postretirement Employee Benefits
    
     In addition to the Company's defined benefit pension plans, the
     Company offers postretirement benefits to its employees who meet
     certain age and service criteria.  Currently, the retirees under age
     65 pay 60% of their health care premium until Medicare benefits
     commence at age 65.  After age 65, Medicare supplemental coverage is
     offered with Company payment of the premium.  For participants who
     retire on or after September 2, 1992, the Company cost, as stated
     above, shall not exceed $150 per month.  In addition, the Company
     offers limited life insurance coverage to active employees and
     retirees.  The postretirement benefit plan is not funded.
     The Company accrues the cost of providing postretirement benefits,
     including medical and life insurance coverage, during the active
     service period of the employee.  The following table presents the
     Company's postretirement benefit plan's status reconciled with amounts
     recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheets under
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 106, Employers'
     Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS 106)

     The PSC has allowed the Company to recover incremental SFAS 106 cost
     through rates on a current basis.  Due to the timing differences
     between the Company's rate case filings and financial reporting
     period, a regulatory asset has been recognized in the amount of
     approximately $30,000 to be recovered from ratepayers in the future.

     Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the nine months ended
     September 30, 1996 and the year ended December 31, 1995 under SFAS 106
     includes the following components:

                                                   1996               1995
    
          Service cost                          $ 10,000             13,000
          Interest cost                           53,000             75,000
          Net amortization and deferrals          22,000             49,000
          Net periodic postretirement
             benefit cost                      $  85,000            137,000
                                                 =======            =======

     For measurement purposes, a 9% annual rate of increase in the per
     capita cost of covered benefits (health care cost trend rate) was
     assumed for 1997.  The rate is assumed to decrease gradually to 6% by
     the year 2012 and remain at that level thereafter.  A 1% increase in
     the actual health care cost rate would result in approximately a 4.4%
     increase in the service and interest cost components to annual net
     periodic postretirement benefit cost and a 4.3% increase in the
     accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.  The weighted average
     discount rate used in determining the actuarial present value of the
     accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.52%.
    
(11) Commitments

     The Company has agreements with six pipeline companies providing for
     pipeline capacity for terms that extend through 2001.  These
     agreements require the payment of a demand charge for contracted
     capacity at FERC approved rates.  Purchased gas costs incurred under
     these pipeline capacity agreements during 1996 and 1995 amounted to
     $3,139,258 and $3,805,687 respectively.  The Company also has short-
     term gas purchase agreements averaging three months in length, with
     prices tied to various indices.  The Company does not anticipate these
     agreements to be in excess of normal capacity requirements.

(12) Disclosures About Fair Value Of Financial Instruments

     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
     value of each class of financial instruments:  Notes Payable - The
     carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short-term
     nature of the borrowings.  Long-term debt - The fair value of the
     Company's long-term debt has been estimated by discounting the future
     principal and interest cash flows using an interest rate for long-term
     debt with similar terms, maturities, and credit ratings.  The

                       INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Corning Natural Gas Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Corning
Natural Gas Corporation and Subsidiary (the Company) as of September 30,
1996 and December 31, 1995, and the related consolidated statements of
income and retained earnings, and cash flows for the nine months ended
September 30, 1996 and the year ended December 31, 1995.  These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Corning
Natural Gas Corporation and Subsidiary at September 30, 1996 and December
31, 1995, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
nine months ended September 30, 1996 and the year ended December 31, 1995
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

The following is a brief description of each nominee, including

1996.  This
committee reviews officer performance and duties and decides upon
appropriate
remuneration.  The Board of Directors met four times in 1996.
Each Director

     At the most recent annual meeting of stockholders of the
Company, held on

at the

at the meeting
with respect to the election of Directors.  Nominees proposed for
election by
the Board of Directors were elected by requisite vote at such
meeting.  Each
nominee received an affirmative vote of over 99% of the votes
cast.

     Cash Compensation of Executive Officers.  The following
table sets forth
the compensation paid or accrued by the Company and its
subsidiary during the
fiscal years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and September 30, 1996
to the
Company's Chief Executive Officer.  Other than the Chief
Executive Officer, no
other executive officer of the Company was paid an annual salary
and bonus in
1996 that aggregated $100,000.  Although only principal
capacities are listed,
the compensation figures include all compensation received in any

(1)  The Company did not pay any long-term compensation to its
Chief Executive
     Officer or to its other executive officers during the fiscal
years ended
     December 31, 1994, 1995 and September 30, 1996.

(2)  1996 amounts reflect compensation received with respect to
     the Company's nine month 1996 fiscal year (ended September
     30, 1996) that result from the adoption by the Company of a
     fiscal year-end of September 30 instead of December 31 each
     year.

     A description of the executive officers, other than Mr.
Thomas K. Barry,
for whom a description is provided above, is set forth below.

     Kenneth J. Robinson (age 52) is Executive Vice President.
Mr. Robinson
joined the Company in 1978 as an accountant.  Most recently he
served as
Financial Vice President and Treasurer for 4 years and in his
current position
for 5 years.
    
     Edgar F. Lewis (age 59) is Senior Vice President -
Operations.  Mr. Lewis'
career with the Company dates back to 1956.  He has been in
charge of operations
for the past 24 years; 16 years in his current position.

     Thomas S. Roye (age 42) is Vice President - Administration.
Mr. Roye has
served 5 years in his current position and was previously
Assistant Treasurer &
Assistant Secretary.  He has prior utility experience and
accounting education
and has been employed since 1978.

     Gary K. Earley (age 42) is Treasurer.  Mr. Earley has been a
practicing
accountant since 1976.  He joined the firm in 1987 as an
accountant in the rates
and regulations department and has served as Treasurer for the
past 5 years.

     Phyllis J. Groeger (age 55) is Corporate Secretary.  Mrs.
Groeger has been
employed since 1973 in a number of positions advancing to
Assistant Secretary in
1986 and has been Secretary of the Company for the past 9 years.
    
     Compensation Pursuant to Plans.  The Company has entered
into separate
supplemental benefits agreements with Thomas K. Barry and one
other executive
officer (collectively, the "Supplemental Benefits Agreements"),
which provide
that the officer covered thereby and retiring after the age of 62
is entitled to
receive monthly payments equal to 35% of such officer's monthly
salary at
retirement for either life or 180 months, whichever is longer.
Such amount
payable shall increase by 4% annually on the anniversary date of
such officer's
retirement.  Retirement benefits otherwise available upon
retirement at age 62
under the Supplemental Benefits Agreements are reduced
cumulatively by 4% for
each year prior to age 60 in which the covered officer retires;
provided,
however, that an officer covered under a Supplemental Benefits
Agreement
receives no retirement benefits thereunder in the event that such
officer
retires before age 55.  Furthermore, the Supplemental Benefits
Agreements
provide that in the event that an officer covered by a
Supplemental Benefits
Agreement dies prior to retirement, such officer's designated
beneficiary is
entitled to receive monthly payments equal to 50% of such
officer's monthly
salary at death for 180 months.

     The Company has also entered into an additional, more
limited, Supplemental
Benefits Agreement with one other employee, which contains terms
similar to the
foregoing agreements.  However, such limited Supplemental
Benefits Agreement
provides for monthly payments equal to 20% of the subject
employee's monthly
salary in the event of retirement, monthly payments equal to 35%
of his monthly
salary in the event of his death prior to retirement, and does
not include an
annual escalator.

     Eligibility to enter into a Supplemental Benefits Agreement,
or equivalent
thereof, is based upon employee performance, service and value to
the Company;
such eligibility is determined on an individual basis by the
Board of Directors.
Currently, Mr. Thomas K. Barry and two other executive officers
(as discussed,
above) are the only employees of the Company covered by a
Supplemental Benefits
Agreement, and no payments have been made to date under such
agreements.  The
Supplemental Benefits Agreements are in addition to the amounts
shown in the
Summary Compensation Table and are not subject to limitation.  As
of September
30, 1996, the estimated annual benefits payable under a
Supplemental Benefits
Agreement upon retirement at the normal retirement age for Mr.
Thomas K. Barry
are $ 45,413.

     The Company also maintains the Corning Natural Gas
Corporation Employees
Savings Plan (the "Savings Plan").  All non-union employees of
the Company who
work for more than 1,000 hours per year and who have completed
one year of
service may participate in the Savings Plan as of the following
January 1 or
July 1.  Under the Savings Plan, participants may contribute up
to 15% of their
wages.  The Company will match one-half of the participant's
contributions up to
a total of 3% of the participant's wages.  Company matching
contributions vest
in the participants at a rate of 20% per year and become fully
vested after five
years.  Participants may select one of five investment plans, or
a combination
thereof, for their account.  Distribution of amounts accumulated
under the
Savings Plan occurs upon the termination of employment or death
of the
participant.  The Savings Plan also contains loan and hardship
withdrawal
provisions.  During the nine month fiscal year ended September
30, 1996, no
amounts were distributed to executive officers under the Savings
Plan.  Mr.
Thomas K. Barry had $2,970 accrued to his account under the
Savings Plan during
said period.  This accrual is included in the figures appearing
in the summary
compensation table on page 4.

     Compensation of Directors.  The current annual Director's
compensation is
$5,000.  In addition, Directors are paid $300 for each Board
meeting attended.
Additionally, the chairmen of the Board's Executive, Audit,
Compensation and
Pension Fund committees and those directors who serve on more
than one committee
receive an annual fee of $1,500 for such services.  Committee
members other than
the chairmen are paid $1,000 annually for their services, subject
to the
limitation that no committee chairman or member may receive more
than $1,500
annually for such services regardless of the number of committees
on which he
serves.

     As allowed by New York law, the Company currently has in
effect an
insurance policy, with an effective date of June 1, 1996, with
National Union
Fire Insurance Company for the indemnification of officers and
directors at an
annual premium cost of $ 43,000.

     Employment Contracts and Termination of Employment and
Change-in-Control
Arrangements.  In January of 1992, the Company entered into an
employment
contract with its President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr.
Thomas K. Barry.
Under the terms of such employment contract, Mr. Barry is
compensated for his
duties as an officer and director with such salary as is
determined from time to
time by the Board of Directors.  The term of Mr. Barry's
employment contract is
five years, unless earlier terminated by an act of either the
Company or Mr.
Barry.  Beginning in 1994, however, the remaining term of Mr.
Barry's employment
contract is automatically extended for an additional one-year
period.  Mr.
Barry's employment contract further provides that upon any change
in control of
the Company leading to the termination of Mr. Barry's employment
with the
Company, the Company shall pay Mr. Barry three times his
then-present annual
salary, or such lesser amount as may be required to comply with
certain
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.

     Selection of Auditors.  KPMG Peat Marwick, Certified Public
Accountants of
Rochester, New York, have been selected as auditors for the
Company for the
ensuing year.  KPMG Peat Marwick, who served as principal
accountants for the
Company for the past fiscal year, have no direct or indirect
financial interest
in the Company or its subsidiaries in the capacity of promoter,
underwriter,
voting director, officer or employee.  A representative of KPMG
Peat Marwick
will be present at the meeting, with the opportunity to make a
statement if such
representative desires to do so, and will be available to respond
to appropriate
questions.

     Other Matters.  Except for the matters set forth above, the
Board of
Directors knows of no matters which may be presented to the
meeting, but if any
other matters properly come before the meeting, it is the
intention of the
persons named in the accompanying form of proxy to vote such
