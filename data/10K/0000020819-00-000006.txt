LISTING OF DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE:
- ----------------------------------------------

(1) Part II-Items 5, 6, 7 and 8 - Annual Report to Shareholders for fiscal year
    ended December 31, 1999.

(2) Part III - Items 10-11, 12 and 13. Definitive proxy statement for the 2000
    Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be filed pursuant to Regulation 14A
    within 120 days after the close of the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999.



Item 1:

Business
- ----------------
The Registrant's operations are presently conducted through its Continuous Power
Systems located in Monrovia, California. The product presently being produced
consist of a line of uninterruptible power supplies (U.P.S.) ranging in size
from 500VA to 10 kVA. The U.P.S is a power system that can both smooth out
voltage fluctuations and maintain a power load under power blackout conditions.
U.P.S.'s are designed to provide fifteen minutes or more (depending on the
number of batteries) of support power to computers, scientific products, commu
nication systems, or similar equipment should the utility power fail. While the
utility power is available, the U.P.S. provides isolation from voltage or fre-
quency transients which may disturb the systems operation.

The Registrant markets the U.P.S line through trade publications, tradeshows and
telemarketing. However, sales are generally made by the Registrant through
distributors who sell the products to end-users. For the year ended 1999, Nova
Power Systems, a major distributor through its direct and indirect sales
accounted for approximately thirty-one percent of the Registrant's total sales

The Registrant assembles finished components and other materials to produce its
products. Relatively little fabrication or raw materials is done by the Regis-
trant. The Registrant purchases raw materials and finished components used in
production of the Registrant's products, some of which are imported. Thus, the
Registrant is dependent upon the ability of suppliers to meet performance speci-
fication, quality standards and delivery schedules. The Registrant endeavors
to assure availability of source of supplies and does not anticipate any
shortages which would adversely affect production schedules.

Competition:
- -----------
The markets for the Registrant's products are highly competitive. The Registrant
is aware of approximately thirty competitors for online UPS products. Many of
these companies have far greater financial resources than the Registrant.
The Registrant competes primarily on the basis of the quality, reliability and
technical sophistication of its products, although price remains an important
factor. The Registrant attempts to locate niche markets for UPS products where
greater reliablity is required by customers.

Substantially, all of the Registrant's products are the subject of on-going
modification and improvement and are subject to scientific and technological
changes.


Backlog
- -------
The following table sets forth the amounts representing orders believed by the
Registrant to be firm. The backlog at December 31, 1999 represent orders which
the Registrant expects to deliver during 2000. There are no seasonal effects
on orders.

Board of Directors and Stockholders
Clary Corporation


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Clary Corporation(a Califor-
nia corporation) as of December 31,1999 and 1998, and the related statements of
operation, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for two years ended.
These financial statements are the responsability of the Company's management.
Our responsability is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material mistate-
ment. An audit includes examining , on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amount and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assesing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statements presentation.
We believe that our audit provide  a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material repects, the financial position of Clary Corporation as of December
31, 1999 and  1998, and the result of its operations and its cash flow for the
years ended, in  conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
