<PAGE>
                     NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS


The Company was incorporated in Delaware in June, 1968.

Business done and intended to be done:

 The principal markets for electrical lighting fixtures are
 firms engaged in the installation of electrical fixtures in
 construction projects and firms installing new or replacement
 electrical fixtures in their own facilities.

 The principal market for electric motors and related services
 is industry in the Western Pennsylvania area.

 The market for the Registrant's investment in real estate is in
 Luquillo, Puerto Rico and Irwin, Pennsylvania.

 The sale of the Registrant's products, except real estate, is
 conducted by direct retail sales to manufacturers or sales to
 distributors.  Real estate sales are conducted by agents of the
 Registrant.

 There have been no significant changes in the kinds of products
 or services rendered or in markets or methods of distribution
 since the beginning of Registrant's fiscal year.

 The sources and availability of raw material essential to
 Registrant's business are not significant factors; however, the
 profitability of Registrant's manufacture, remanufacture,
 repair and sale of coils, lighting products, transformers,
 electric motors and similar equipment is affected by the price
 of materials.

 Patents, licenses, franchises and concessions are not
 significant factors to Registrant's business.  Also, none of
 the Registrant's segments are significantly seasonal.

 There are three significant customers of the Company's
 Electrical Lighting Products Division and one significant
 customer of the Company's Electrical Motor Repair Division. 
 These customers accounted for approximately 90% and 10% of the
 net revenue of each respective division and 58% of the
 Company's total net sales.  All significant customers are
 independent of the Registrant.  See note 14 to the Registrant's
 financial statements.

     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                         AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Liquidity

Management expects cash flow to be restrictive over the next few
years as available cash will be used to liquidate the notes
payable and accrued interest owed by the Registrant.  Major
factors affecting the Registrant's liquidity include the
following:

1.   At the present time, related parties, which are owed in
     excess of $2.1 million in notes payable and accrued
     interest, have not charged the Registrant interest on the
     portion of the liability representing accrued interest.  

2.   The Registrant has an available line of credit with Dollar
     Bank for $150,000 with annual interest at the bank's prime
     rate plus 1-1/2%.  As of December 31, 1995, $91,000 had
     been borrowed on the line of credit. 

3.   The Registrant continues to actively attempt to sell its
     property in Puerto Rico.  Management believes the property
     to have a value in excess of two million dollars, but
     recognizes that achieving this value will require
     additional time and effort which may be extended and
     substantial.

4.   The Company also sold property in Irwin, Pennsylvania
     during 1995 and 1996 with proceeds totalling approximately
     $300,000.

There are no commitments for any major capital expenditures at
December 31, 1995.

Net Sales

The 1995 manufacturing sales of $2,477,000 reflect a decrease of
$1,027,000 for the year.  This decrease was primarily
attributable to decreased volume of electrical lighting products
sales due to a significant decrease from a major customer.  The
Registrant is actively pursuing alternative business areas and
anticipates sales will remain constant in 1996.

Cost of Product Sold

The cost of raw material, labor and purchased services are
stable, with the exception of normal inflationary increases.

Research and Development Expenses

There have been no significant research and development expenses
during the last two fiscal years.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

The selling, general and administrative expenses, exclusive of
attorney fees, are stable.  Attorney fees decreased in 1995 by
approximately $4,000.

Interest and Financing Expense

The interest rate on the notes payable to related parties is
prime plus 1% as it was in years previous to 1995.

Net Earnings

The Company's ability to increase profitability is dependent on a
number of factors.  These include a recovery from the current
industry recession, increased sales and the conclusion of
litigation (as mentioned in Note 9 to the financial statements). 
The sale of the land held for sale would also have a positive
effect on net earnings.

Business in General

Backlogs existing for the electrical lighting products were
approximately $500,000 and $1,000,000 as of December 31, 1995 and
December 31, 1994, respectively.  A portion of such backlog must
await release instructions from the purchaser and can be held for
some time.  However, all of the backlog can be delivered within
the current fiscal year.

The manufacture and sale of electrical lighting products and the
manufacture and repair of electric motors and similar equipment
are highly competitive.  Numerous larger companies with greater
resources compete with the Registrant in the market for these
products.  Sales of lighting products are directly affected by
the level of industrial and commercial construction.  The
Registrant's sales of land investment in Puerto Rico are affected
by the general economic conditions of Puerto Rico.

Registrant employs approximately 25 employees relating to the
manufacture and sale of electric lighting products and
approximately 10 employees relating to the manufacture and repair
of electric motors and similar equipment and the distribution of
electrical products.  There are not expected to be significant
changes in the number of employees in 1996.

whose aggregate direct remuneration exceeded $100,000 for the

Shop Materials Company, a corporation in which all voting
securities are owned by Vincent E. Oswald, received certain
accounting services, office space, office staff, telephone, and
management services from the Company and reimbursed the Company
for such services.

In 1995, Shop Materials Company paid approximately $46,700 for
such services.  The Company believes that amounts received for
such services and space are fair and reasonable and are as fair
as amounts which would be received from non-affiliates for such
services and space.

Gretchen Oswald has loaned the Company prior to December 31, 1995
$60,000 and $20,000 payable on demand with interest at 10% and
8%, respectively.  There is no outstanding interest on these
loans at December 31, 1995.

Vincent E. Oswald and Shop Materials Company have, from time to
time prior to and including the fiscal year ended December 31,
1995, made various loans to the Company, payable upon demand with
interest at the prime rate plus one (1%) percent.  The present
outstanding balance of such loans is $1,027,890.  The terms of
the loans are as favorable as the Company could have obtained
from unrelated parties.  The outstanding interest on the above
loans to and including December 31, 1995 is $1,067,933.

Neither Mr. Oswald nor Shop Materials Company have charged the
Company interest on the accrued interest balance and have
provided the Company flexibility in making payments on the
interest.<PAGE>

for the years then ended, appearing on pages 10 through 19 of
this Annual Report.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on

                      NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
            FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 AND 1994

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly
    liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three
    months or less to be cash equivalents.

    Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
    (first-in, first-out method) or market.

    Property, Plant and Equipment - The cost of the assets is
    depreciated using straight-line and accelerated methods over
    their estimated useful lives for financial statement and tax
    return purposes.

    Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
    of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

2.  INVENTORIES

    Inventories consist of the following:
                                             1995          1994
                                                                  
        Raw Materials                  $  434,893    $  471,519

        Finished Goods                    252,277       198,728   
                                       $  870,361    $  867,690   

3.  LINE OF CREDIT

    In 1994, the Company established a $150,000 line of credit
    with Dollar Bank.  Borrowings bear interest at the bank's
    prime rate plus 1-1/2%.  The line of credit is personally
    guaranteed by the principal shareholder of the Company.  At
    December 31, 1995, $91,000 had been borrowed on the line of
    credit.  At December 31, 1994 there were no borrowings under
    this arrangements.

7.  ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

    The Company owns land in Puerto Rico which is being actively
    offered for sale.  This land is recorded at the Company's
    cost, $557,439 and $582,861 at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
    respectively, which is estimated to be less than net
    realizable value.

    The Company owned rental property in Irwin, Pennsylvania
    which was being actively offered for sale.  During 1996,
    management of the Company sold this property for $232,000.

8.  INCOME TAXES

    As required by FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income
    Taxes", the Company uses the liability method of accounting
    for income taxes.

    For Federal Income Tax reporting purposes, the Company has
    available $2,400,000 of net operating loss carryforwards as
    of December 31, 1995.  If unused, these amounts will expire
    in varying amounts beginning in 1997 through 2010.  For state
    income tax reporting purposes, the Company has $820,000 of
    net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 1995.  If
    unused, these amounts will expire in varying amounts 
    beginning in 1996 and 1997.

    These losses result in a deferred tax asset which has been
    reduced to zero by a valuation allowance due to a trend of
    minimal taxable income in prior years.

                                             1995           1994
    
        Deferred Tax Asset             $  891,000    $   912,000

    Significant components of income tax expense from continuing
    operations consist of the following at December 31, 1995 and
    1994:

        Current - State                $      -0-    $     3,794
        Puerto Rico                        32,000            -0-
                                       $   32,000    $     3,794

9.  LITIGATION

    On June 21, 1990, the Company was awarded damages of
    $1,009,000 from a former employee of the Company and his
    related entities.  The judgement was the result of a long-
    standing suit by the Company against the former employee and
    his related entities.  The Company is currently involved in
    several related lawsuits in order to collect the judgement. 
    In 1992, the Company received $171,000 as settlement in a
    lawsuit with a financial institution related to the lawsuit
    against the former employee.  The net proceeds were used to
    reduce a receivable in the amount of $44,016 with the
    remaining $126,984 recorded as income in 1992.  The Company
    used the proceeds to purchase three first mortgages from the
    financial institution secured by three rental properties. 
    The mortgagee of each of these properties was the former
    employee.  The mortgagee defaulted on payment on all the
    mortgages.  The Company took possession of these properties
    during 1994.  The properties were sold in 1995 and 1996. 
    (See Note 7)

10. CONTINUING OPERATIONS

    At December 31, 1995 the Company had negative working capital
    of $1,468,800, and shareholders' deficit of $351,126.  As
    discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements, the Company
    owes related parties in excess of $2.1 million in loans and
    accrued interest.  In the past, the officer has not charged
    the Company interest on the portion of the debt representing
    accrued interest and has only demanded payment to the extent
    of available cash flow.  Continued operations of the Company
    are dependent on receiving continued favorable financial
    assistance from the officer.  The officer has represented
    that he will continue to provide this assistance.  It is the
    intent of the Company that available proceeds from the sale
    of Real Estate Held for Sale will be used to liquidate this
    obligation.
