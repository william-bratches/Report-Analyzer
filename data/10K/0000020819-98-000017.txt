LISTING OF DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE:
- ----------------------------------------------

(1) Part II-Items 5, 6, 7 and 8 - Annual Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 
    ended December 31, 1997.

(2) Part III - Items 10-11, 12 and 13. Definitive proxy statement for the 1997
    Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be filed pursuant to Regulation 14A
    within 120 days after the close of the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997.



Item 1:

Business
- ----------------
The Registrant's operations are presently conducted through its Continuous Power
Systems located in Monrovia, California. The product presently being produced
consist of a line of uninterruptible power supplies (U.P.S.) ranging in size
from 500VA to 37.5 kVA. The U.P.S is a power system that can both smooth out
voltage fluctuations and maintain a power load under power blackout conditions. 
U.P.S.'s are designed to provide fifteen minutes or more (depending on the
number of batteries) of support power to computers, scientific products, commu
nication systems, or similar equipment should the utility power fail, While the
utility power is available, the U.P.S. provides isolation from voltage or fre-
quency transients which may disturb the systems operation. 

The Registrant markets the U.P.S line through trade publication, tradeshows and
telemarketing. However, sales are generally made by the Registrant through
distributors who sell the products to end-users. For the year ended 1997, Nova
Power Systems, a major distributor through its direct and indirect sales  
accounted for approximately thirty-eight percent of the Registrant's total sales

The Registrant assembles finished components and other materials to produce its
products. Relatively little fabrication or raw materials is done by the Regis-
trant. The Registrant purchases raw materials and finished components used in
production of the Registrant's products, some of which are imported. Thus, the
Registrant is dependent upon ability of suppliers to meet performance speci-
fication, quality standards and delivery schedules. The Registrant endeavors
to assure availability of source of supplies and does not anticipate any 
shortages which would adversely affect production schedules.

Competition:
- -----------
The markets for the Registrant's products are highly competitive. The Registrant
is aware of approximately thirty competitors for online UPS products. Many of
these companies have far greater financial resources than the Registrant.
The Registrant competes primarily on the basis of the quality, reliability and
technical sophistication of its products, although price remains an important
factor. The Registrant attempts to locate niche markets for UPS products where
greater reliablity is required by customers.

Substantially, all of the Registrant's products are the subject of on-going 
modification and improvement and are subject to scientific and technological
changes.


Backlog
- -------
The following table sets forth the amounts representing orders believed by the
Registrant to be firm. The backlog at December 31, 1997 represent orders which
the Registrant expects to deliver during 1998. There are no seasonal effects
on orders.

During fiscal year 1997 properties were utilized at approximately 60% of 
capacity.

The Registrant believes its properties are suitable for its needs and in late
1997 began negotiations with its landlord for a minimum two year extension on
its current lease with no increase in rental rates.

Item 3: Legal Proceedings
- -------------------------
In 1990, the Company entered into a verbal distribution agreement granting a 
distributor the non-exclusive right to distribute certain products of its former
CAD Division. In 1991, the Company filed suit to recover the uncollected balance
of its receivables due from the distributor. The distributor filed a countersuit
alleging misrepresentation. On May 24, 1993, the jury awarded the distributor
net damages of approximately $264,000 including double damages, legal costs and
interest. In November 1993, the Company filed an appeal against this judgment
and provided a supersedeas bond secured by $300,000 certificate of deposit.
On November 8, 1994, the Court of Appeals issued on order reversing the trial
courts judgment against the Company. On January 23, 1995, the distributor filed
an Application for Writ of Error with the Supreme Court of Texas.
On July 7,1995, the Supreme Court of Texas ordered the judgment of the Court of
Appeals be reversed and the cause be remanded back to that court for further
proceedings. On July 20, 1995, the Company filed a Motion for Rehearing with the
Supreme Court. On May 6, 1996, The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Court
of Appeals for consideration on the merits aside from the previous issues 
submitted to them. On July 3, 1997, the Court of Appeals rendered a judgment on 
Remand reversing, remanding, rendering and affirming, in part, the judgment of
the original trial court. Essentially, the Court of Appeals reduced the net
damages to approximately 20% of the original award. The distributor filed for a
hearing the Supreme Court of Texas on the Appeal Court judgment. On February 13,
1998. the Supreme Court of Texas denied the petition for review in this case
leaving intact the decision by the Court of Appeals. At this time, it is unknown
if the distributor will file for Motion for Rehearing. Management has estimated
a range of amounts for the potential loss, including legal costs, relating to
this matter and an amount considered by management to be the probable loss was
provided for in the Statement of Operations for 1993 as loss from discontinued
operations. After the Supreme Court ordered the judgment of the Court of Appeals
be reversed, the company established additional reserves in 1996. An unfavorable
resolution of this matter to the company could result in an additional lia-
bility of approximately $150,000 which has not been reflected in financial
statements.
