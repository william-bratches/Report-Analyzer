                              PART I
ITEM 1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
          The Registrant (sometimes alternatively referred to in this report
as the Company or EMCEE) is a corporation, organized and existing under the
laws of the State of Delaware, having been incorporated in 1960.
          The Registrant is engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of
Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS) microwave transmitters and
related equipment for the wireless cable industry and low power television
(LPTV) transmitters and related equipment for the television broadcast
industry. These principal products are distributed primarily through the
Registrant's sales staff and independent representatives, with most sales
occurring in the commercial, educational and private television system
markets. The Registrant also provides all services relative to the design,
procurement and installation of television broadcast stations, with the
exception of licensing submissions.
          For more than the past three years, the Company's primary sales and
marketing focus has been on the wireless cable industry. While the Company was
also involved in the manufacture and sale of products to the LPTV market
during the same period of time, LPTV product sales have been overwhelmingly
subordinate to the Company's MMDS products. The Company anticipates that its
MMDS sales will continue to dominate in both domestic and foreign markets.
          At March 31, 1998, the Registrant employed 66 people, of whom 64
were full time employees.
          The Registrant has a variety of raw material sources available to
conduct its present business. However, substantial periods of lead time for
delivery are sometimes experienced by the Registrant, making it necessary to
inventory varied quantities of materials.
          Significant portions of the Registrant's revenues come from
contracts with customers who generally do not place orders on a regular basis.
In addition,the timing of these contracts relate to economic and regulatory
developments over which the Registrant has little or no control.
          In fiscal year 1998, purchases by three MMDS customers constituted,
in the aggregate, $2,261,789, or approximately 24.6% of the Company's net
sales. Although these purchases were significant in both amount and as a
percentage of sales, the Company's management believes that the loss of any or
all of these customers would not have a material adverse impact on the
Company. 
          The Registrant's principal suppliers are Andrew Corporation, Fujitsu
Corporation, and Microwave Filter Company, Inc.
          Substantially all of the Registrant's domestic products must receive
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval prior to being marketed and
sold. As of the date of this report, the Registrant does not have any product
material to the Registrant's business pending approval by the FCC.
          While FCC regulations, as promulgated or amended from time to time,
can have an effect on the demand for the Registrant's domestic products, the
Registrant does not presently know of any existing governmental regulation and
does not anticipate any probable governmental regulation which would have a
material effect on its business. However, recently issued FCC regulations
concerning high definition television (HDTV) may, for an interim period ending
as early as 2006, create a temporary market for a 2.5 kilowatt UHF transmitter 


<PAGE>
developed by the Registrant and an unaffiliated entity which will facilitate
the simulcasting of HDTV and ordinary television signals. This technology is
still in the testing phase and is not presently being utilized by operators on
a regular basis. In fiscal year 1999, the Registrant has plans to further test
this technology with a public television station in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
          Through a subsidiary, the Registrant is involved in a joint venture
with another entity to provide wireless high speed Internet access. Wireless
high speed Internet access involves connecting to the Internet using MMDS
transmitters. Although more expensive than traditional telephone Internet
access, wireless high speed Internet access technology, like its name
suggests, enables the user to access and utilize the Internet much faster than
through the telephone, so much so that a user can download information and
data from the Internet approximately 47 times faster than can be done using a
regular telephone modem. While the joint venture is not presently selling this
service to consumers or businesses, an application to do so in Utah is pending
before the FCC. If this business eventually proves successful, the Registrant
will seek to become involved in providing the service to other areas of the
United States as well.
          By way of a partially owned subsidiary, EMCEE Broadcast Products
(Chengdu) Company, Ltd., and an agreement with an independent Chinese company,
the Registrant is seeking to increase sales in China. At present, the
Registrant sells both companies MMDS transmitter assembly kits. Eventually,
the Registrant hopes that these companies will be able to carry out
approximately 30% of the manufacturing process. 
          The amount of money spent on the Registrant's research and
development activities in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 was,
respectively,$444,669 and $377,557. An additional $61,296 and $20,000 of
research and development costs were funded by customers in fiscal years 1997
and 1998, respectively.
          Competitive conditions in the Registrant's industry continue to be
intense. Nevertheless, in the field of MMDS, the Registrant occupies a strong
position among its competitors.
          In the Registrant's opinion, the primary methods of competition in
its industry are product pricing, the ready availability of quality products
to accommodate demand, offering quality service of products after sale, and
maintaining a reputation for having a high degree of technical knowledge. 
          There has been no material effect on the Registrant as a result of
compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws. 
          The Registrant's principal corporate logos, EMCEE and EMCEE
Broadcast Products, are registered in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office and are used by the Registrant pursuant to a license with its wholly
owned subsidiary corporation, EMCEE Cellular Inc., which owns the marks. In
the same manner, the Registrant also uses the trademark, Site Lock, which is a
mark associated with a product sold by the Registrant that enhances picture
quality for MMDS systems in close proximity to systems operating on the same
frequency, and utilizes a patent for a solid state S-band transmitter.
ITEM 2.  DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
          The Registrant conducts operations at its facility located on 25
acres, which the Registrant owns in fee, in White Haven, Pennsylvania.
          The building was constructed specifically for the Registrant in 1968
and consists of approximately 27,000 square feet, with the majority of the
area 




<PAGE>
devoted to manufacturing. The front portion of the building, consisting of two 
floors, houses administrative, engineering and sales offices. The land,
building and improvements are well maintained and in good condition.
          The Registrant's land, building and improvements are subject to
encumbrances held by the Registrant's primary lending institution, CoreStates
Bank, N.A. These encumbrances secure the Registrant's working line of credit,
mortgage loan and two term loans with the lender. As of the date of this
report, the aggregate principal balance of these encumbrances is $848,060.
          Presently, the Registrant also leases approximately 9,000 square
feet of space in White Haven, Pennsylvania, for research and development
activities, as well as a warehouse in which it stores certain equipment and
archival documents.
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
          There is no information relevant to the Registrant which must be
disclosed under this Item 3.
ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
          No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 1998.
                             PART II
ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
          The NASDAQ National Market is the principal market on which the
Registrant's common stock is traded.

ITEM 6.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



<PAGE>
          Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998 totaled
$9,188,000, a decrease of 27% compared to net sales of $12,523,000 for fiscal
year ended March 31, 1997 and continued the downward trend from net sales of
$14,293,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996.
          The reduction of shipments for the last two years is attributed to
a large foreign contract, which was terminated in fiscal 1998, and the
reduction of domestic demand due to the inability of Multichannel Multipoint
Distribution Service (MMDS) operators to fund new projects.
          The termination of the large foreign contract, which entailed
equipment shipments to Saudi Arabia, has been resolved to the satisfaction of
both parties.  Additional shipments for this project will be nominal, and the
contractor has indicated that the systems, which were originally designed as
analog, will be changed to digital.  The future status of the project is
unknown to the Registrant at this time.
          Domestic demand in the MMDS industry started its decline in the
second quarter of fiscal 1997 and continued as operators waited for successful
testing and installation of digital compression technology.  The major
operators, who have historically been highly leveraged, are having cash flow
problems, and it appears that industry demand will not improve until
additional funding sources
are found.
          An optimistic sign in the domestic MMDS industry involves field
trials that have been underway for the past year, some of which include EMCEE
manufactured equipment.  These trials involve the use of the MMDS spectrum for
the transmission of high speed data (Internet) and telephony (wireless local
loop).  In addition to the ongoing trials, several MMDS operators have already
begun using the MMDS spectrum for high speed Internet service.  The Company
expects that over the next few years, MMDS operators will be adding high speed
Internet and telephony services to the traditional video services currently
provided.  The addition of these services should have a positive impact on the
Registrant's future MMDS business. 
          Foreign shipments for fiscal 1998 were $5,563,000, compared to
$7,056,000 for fiscal 1997 and $8,174,000 for fiscal 1996.  Shipments in
fiscal 1997 included $2,113,000 for the large contract mentioned above, while
shipments in fiscal 1996 included $2,647,000 for a large contract in Malaysia. 
Foreign shipments comprised 61%, 56% and 57% of total sales for the fiscal
years 1998, 1997 and 1996 respectively.
          Gross profit for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998 was
$3,070,000 or 33.4% of net shipments, compared to a gross profit of $4,500,000
(35.9% of net shipments) for fiscal year ended March 31, 1997.  The decrease
in gross profit dollars and as a percent of sales for the last two fiscal
periods reflects the decrease in volume.  Product mix between EMCEE
manufactured product (in which the Company receives a higher margin)and
original equipment manufactured by others (O.E.M.) did not have a significant
effect in the three years under review. Fiscal 1998 did include a cancellation
fee of a moderate six figure amount with minimal direct costs.
          Operating expenses totaled $2,886,000 for the year ended March 31,
1998, a reduction of $229,000 (7%) from the prior year.  Selling expense
decreased $75,000; general and administrative expense decreased $87,000 and
research and development decreased $67,000.
          Selling expense was reduced in personnel and personnel related
expense (including commissions) as the cost containment program started in
fiscal 1997 was continued in fiscal 1998.  Shows and conventions expense did

<PAGE>
increase approximately $37,000 in fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997,
primarily for international shows committed to in the previous year.  The
shows and conventions budget for fiscal 1999 has been reduced by 48%.  
          General and administrative costs totaled $1,099,000 for the year
ended March 31, 1998, compared to $1,186,000 for the year ended March 31,
1997. Legal expense decreased $74,000; in the prior year, costs were incurred
relating to international contracts and from the change in the Registrants's
primary lending institution. A reduction in recruiting costs of approximately
$22,000 was also realized in the latest fiscal year. 
          Research and development expense totaled $378,000 for fiscal year
ended March 31, 1998, compared to $445,000 for the previous year.  Credits for
payments received for non-recurring engineering (NRE) totaled $20,000 for the
year just ended, compared to $61,000 received for fiscal 1997.  Reduction of
expenses for the most recent year occurred in labor and labor related expenses
and consulting reflecting additional cost containment.  Nonetheless, the
Company is committed to research and development especially in the digital,
Internet and high definition television (HDTV) technology.
          Other income (expense), net totaled $479,000 for the year ended
March 31, 1998, compared to $2,759,000 for the year ended March 31, 1997.  The
prior year included an amount of $2,500,000 received as a settlement of a note
receivable for a cellular license sold in fiscal 1992.  The money, which was
received in April, 1998, was invested in Treasury Bills and money market
accounts realizing interest income of $260,000 for fiscal 1998, compared to
$110,000 for the previous year.
          Payments on long-term debt decreased the amount of interest expense
incurred for fiscal 1998 to $84,000 from $93,000 for fiscal 1997.
          The Registrant sold its remaining stock in Wireless Cable of
Atlanta, which was acquired by BellSouth, Inc., netting a profit of $277,000
in the year ended March 31, 1998, compared to a gain of $210,000 realized in
the prior year.
          Other income totaled $25,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31,
1998, compared to $32,000 for the year ended March 31, 1997.  Other income for
both years consisted primarily of rental income and forfeitures of customers'
down payments.
          Net income before income taxes for fiscal 1998 was $662,000, while
net income before income taxes totaled $4,143,000 for fiscal 1997.
          Federal income taxes for the year ended March 31, 1997 totaled
$1,127,000 or 27% of net income before federal taxes.  The amount paid was
positively impacted due to the Registrants' use of a Foreign Sales Corporation
(FSC).  Federal income taxes for the year ended March 31, 1998 totaled
$146,000 or 22% of net income before federal income taxes.  Again, the Company
utilized the FSC and other tax credits to reduce income taxes; however, as a
prior year is under examination by the Internal Revenue Service, an additional
amount of approximately $54,000 has been included which, in management's
opinion, is adequate for any potential additional tax liability related to the
examination. As of the date of this report, a proposed settlement of any such
additional tax liability is pending approval by the Internal Revenue Service.
There is no state tax liability for periods under review since all profitable

</TABLE>
          The first quarter of fiscal 1997 was impacted favorably by the sales
to one customer for the Saudi Arabia contract.  Earnings for the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1997 included receipt of $2,500,000 of proceeds on a Note
Receivable for a fiscal 1992 cellular license sale. 
Impact of Year 2000
          The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs written using
two digits rather than four to designate the applicable year.  The Registrant
has a single source for its mainframe software programming.  It has received
upgrades and has installed these upgrades that have been certified by the
vendor to be year 2000 compliant.  Tests have been conducted on the existing
network and personal computers and the Company believes that the Year 2000
issue will neither pose significant operational problems for its computer
systems nor will it have a material impact on the results of operations of the
Company.  While the Registrant is unaware of any Year 2000 problems with any
significant suppliers or customers, there can be no guarantee that the systems
of other companies, if not compliant, will not have an adverse effect on the
Registrant.  
Liquidity and Capital Resources
          The Company anticipates that industry demand for MMDS equipment,
especially domestic, will be soft for the remainder of calendar year 1998. 
Management is optimistic, however, in the potential application for high-speed
Internet service using this equipment.  The Company is investing in
development and marketing of this product.


<PAGE>
          The Company's cash requirements were satisfied in fiscal 1998
principally from the cash flow from the sale of the cellular license, cash
from operations, cash on hand and customers' deposits.  These funds were
sufficient to meet the Company's working capital expenditures and required
debt payments.
          Cash and cash equivalents increased from $681,000 as of March 31, 
1997 to $2,530,000 as of March 31, 1998 and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from
$1,679,000 to $2,270,000 for the same time periods.  The increase is primarily
due to the cash received in April of 1997 for the note receivable settlement
discussed above.
          The accounts receivable balance of $1,215,000 as of March 31, 1998
is $281,000 more than the balance at March 31, 1997.  Although shipments were
less for fiscal year ended March 31, 1998 compared to the prior year, sales
for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 were 23% higher than the corresponding
quarter one year ago.  The Company wrote-off $90,000 of accounts receivable
during fiscal 1998 compared to a write-off of $30,000 for fiscal 1997. 
Reserve for doubtful accounts of $35,000 is believed by management to be
adequate as of March 31, 1998.
          Deposits from customers increased from $121,000 as of March 31, 1997
to $260,000 as of March 31, 1998 due to the sales volume increase for the
comparable fourth quarters.
          Inventories totaled $3,439,000 at March 31, 1998, a decrease of
$189,000 from the prior year end as controls were implemented to utilize
inventory that had been purchased for the large Saudi Arabia project.
          Prepaid expenses totaled $115,000 as of March 31, 1998, as compared
to $379,000 for March 31, 1997, with the difference being primarily for
prepaid federal income taxes for the later year.  Deferred income taxes, net,
changed from a $554,000 deferred tax liability at March 31, 1997 to an $80,000
deferred tax asset at March 31, 1998 primarily due to the $2,500,000 note
receivable being recognized in the Company's financial statements in fiscal
1997 and the Company's consolidated income tax return in fiscal 1998.
          Property, plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation equaled
$826,000 as of March 31, 1998 a reduction of $233,000 compared to the same
date one year earlier.  Purchases of new equipment were $31,000 for the year
ended March 31, 1998 while depreciation expense totaled $264,000.  One Hundred
Five Thousand ($105,000) Dollars of fully depreciated assets was written-off
in fiscal 1998.
          Other assets of $108,000 as of March 31, 1997 consisted primarily of
the Company's investment in a Wireless Cable operator referred to above.  The
balance of this stock was sold in fiscal 1998 for a profit of $277,000.  In
fiscal 1998, the Registrant, through a subsidiary, and,  along with two other
parties, formed a limited liability company to operate an Internet service
entity. The Company's initial investment in the limited liability company was
$210,000, which was increased subsequent to March 31, 1998 to $470,000.
However, as a result of another equity holder's contractual "buy down right",
the Company's investment will be reduced to $130,000.00 or 10% of the limited
liability company's outstanding equity.  The Company cannot know at this time
the likelihood or amount of profit (if any) that will be generated. 
Management does believe that the knowledge obtained in operating an Internet
services will be valuable in marketing the equipment.  The balance of $1,450
in the other asset categories at March 31, 1998 represents costs associated
with organizing subsidiaries of the Registrant.


<PAGE>
          Note receivable of $500,000 for the periods March 31, 1998 and March
31, 1997 is the balance owing the Company as the result of a settlement
reached in connection with the sale of a cellular license in fiscal 1992.  As
there is no definite collection period set and because there is not a
reasonable basis of collection, the receivable is fully reserved.
          Long-term debt, including the current portion, totaled $864,000 as
of March 31, 1998, compared to $915,000 as of March 31, 1997.  An amount of 
$70,000 was procured at the early part of fiscal 1998 to finance  engineering
test equipment.  A total of $121,000 was paid against long-term debt during
this year. Current portion of payments as of March 31, 1998 and March 31, 1997
were $117,000 and $108,000, respectively.
          There was no significant difference in the balance of accounts
payable as of the year ended  March 31, 1998 and 1997.
          Accrued expenses, payroll and related expenses of $277,000 at March
31, 1998, compared to March 31, 1997 of $207,000, included additional
commissions and payroll accruals due to timing differences.  Other accrued
expense decreased a nominal $11,000 for the same periods.
          Common stock and additional paid in capital totaled $3,575,000 as of
March 31, 1998, or a decrease of $60,000 over the balance at March 31, 1997. 
Treasury stock increased from $1,362,000 as of March 31, 1997 to $1,649,000 as
of March 31, 1998.  A stock award of 18,560 shares of Company stock was
granted as a bonus to an officer during fiscal 1998 by transferring 12,763
shares of Treasury Stock held as of March 31, 1997 and issuing the balance
from authorized but unissued common stock. The Company, through a wholly owned
subsidiary, purchased on the open market 119,000 shares of the Company's stock
during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998 for a total cash outlay of
$381,000.  The Company's management has been authorized by the Board of
Directors to purchase up to $600,000 of Company stock.  As of the date of this
report, the Company has purchased an additional 30,000 shares in the first
quarter of fiscal 1999 for approximately $91,000.
          In addition to the above mentioned purchases, an additional 1,764
shares were purchased during the year ended March 31, 1998 from former
employees under the KSOP plan agreement for a cost of $6,000.
          Inflation has not had a significant impact on cost or price in the
two fiscal years under review. However, as a significant portion of component
materials are obtained from sources outside the United States and especially
from Asia, and significant portions of the Company's sales have historically
been to the Pacific Rim, financial problems in these countries could have a
significant affect on the business of the Registrant for the next fiscal year.
          The backlog of unsold orders as of March 31, 1998 was $2,421,000
compared to $2,853,000 as of March 31, 1997.  The present backlog is expected
to be shipped in the first six months of fiscal 1999.
          EMCEE and Superior Group Corporation are partners in a joint venture
company named EMCEE Broadcast Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd ("EMCEE - Chengdu"),
for purposes of manufacturing and marketing wireless cable transmitters.  The
products will be manufactured from EMCEE-Chengdu's factory located in Chengdu
City, Capital City of Sichuan Province, People's Republic of China. 
Production is expected to begin in the summer of 1998.

                   Independent Auditors' Report



Board of Directors
EMCEE Broadcast Products, Inc.
White Haven, Pennsylvania

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of EMCEE Broadcast Products,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1998 and 1997 and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the
years then ended.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EMCEE
Broadcast Products, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1998 and 1997, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

          EMCEE BROADCAST PRODUCTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 1998 AND 1997
                                 
1.  Summary of significant accounting policies:

Principles of consolidation:
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EMCEE Broadcast
Products, Inc. and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned (together,
the Company).  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated.

Revenue recognition, sale of license:
During 1992, a rural cellular license was sold for $3,100,000.  The initial
payment was $845,000, net of closing costs of $155,000.  The $2,100,000
balance, which bore interest at 7% payable at maturity, was due in December
1996.  None of the deferred payment and the related interest income was
recognized prior to 1997 because of their extended collection period and
because there was not a reasonable basis to evaluate the likelihood of
collection.  On April 3, 1997 the Company collected $2,500,000 and received a
non-interest bearing, unsecured $500,000 note receivable as settlement of the
original note. The $500,000 note receivable is due and payable upon the
occurrence of any one or more of certain specified events involving the debtor
including, but not limited to, acquisition, merger, bankruptcy, and
insolvency.  None of the specified events relate to the debtor's normal
operations.  The note receivable is fully reserved because it has no definite
collection period and because there is not a reasonable basis to evaluate the
likelihood of collection.

Cash, equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills:
The Company considers cash equivalents to be all highly liquid investments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.  U.S. Treasury
Bills with an original maturity of more than three months are considered to be
investments.  All U.S. Treasury Bills are stated at cost which approximates
market and are considered as available for sale.  All U.S. Treasury Bills  not
included as cash equivalents had contracted maturities of at least six months.

Inventories:
Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates
current actual cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market (net realizable
value).

Property, plant and equipment and depreciation:
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is provided on

These expenses are recorded when incurred.  They amounted to $78,000 and
$75,000 for 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Fair value:
The fair value of long-term debt that is variable rate debt that reprices
regularly, the notes receivable of $2,500,000 which were collected in April

<PAGE>
1997 and U.S. Treasury Bills approximates the amounts recorded in the
financial statements.  It was not practicable to estimate the fair value of
the $500,000 note receivable  because the Company was unable to estimate the
timing and form of the ultimate settlement of the amount due to it.  The
Company has fully provided for any potential loss resulting from the
non-payment of this receivable.
Use of estimates:
Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements. 
Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the
reported revenues and expenses.

Reclassifications:
Certain amounts reported in the 1997 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the 1998 presentation.
2. Income per share:

Basic income per share is computed by dividing earnings applicable to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. 
Diluted income per share  is similar to basic income per share except that the
weighted average of common shares outstanding is increased to include the
number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the
dilutive potential common shares had been issued.  There were no dilutive
potential common shares in 1998 because the assumed exercise of the options
would be anti-dilutive.  Income per share for 1997 has been restated based
upon the provisions of a revised accounting standard that become effective in
the current year.
The following table presents the basic and diluted EPS computations:

$2,095,000 is not insured.

4.Industry, sales and accounts receivable concentration information:

The Company's primary activity is in one segment which consists of the
assembly and sale of equipment for the domestic and foreign television
broadcasting industry.  Major customers are those that individually account
for more than 10% of the Company's consolidated revenues.  For the years ended
March 31, 1998 and 1997, one customer with total sales of $939,000 and two
customers with total sales of $3,476,000, respectively,  qualified as  major
customers.  Worldwide export sales amounted to $5,563,000 and $7,056,000 for
1998 and 1997, respectively.  At March 31, 1998 and 1997, there were no
significant accounts receivable concentrations.  The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers and typically requires deposits and a
letter of credit on foreign sales and deposits on domestic sales. 
Historically, the Company's uncollectible accounts receivable have been
immaterial.

6.  Line of credit:

The Company has a line of credit agreement with a bank aggregating $2,000,000
collateralized by inventories, accounts receivable and all property, plant and
equipment.  The line of credit agreement requires monthly interest payments at
 .50% below the bank's prime rate of interest or 1.75% above LIBOR  which was
5.625% at March 31, 1998.  There were no principal borrowings during the years
ended March 31, 1998 and 1997.

The loan agreement contains restrictive covenants when amounts are outstanding
which, among other things, require the Company to maintain a maximum total
liabilities to net worth ratio, a minimum current ratio and a debt coverage
ratio.  The Company is allowed to pay dividends on its common stock if it is
in compliance with the financial covenants and ratios.

The term loan, bank at March 31, 1998 matures in 2012 and requires principal
payments of $4,083, plus interest.  Interest is calculated at 2.25% above
LIBOR which was 5.625% at March 31, 1998.  The bank has the option of
adjusting the monthly payments required under this loan to provide for changes
in the interest rates.  The term and equipment loans are cross-collateralized
with and have the same restrictive covenants as the line of credit (see Note
6).

Principal payments on long-term debt, based on current interest rates, are as
follows:

                       1999             $  117,000

At March 31, 1998, 36,675 and 115,200 options had an exercise price of $3.44
and $6.16, respectively.  Such options had remaining contractual lives of 2.3
years and 3.7 years, respectively.

The Company in accordance with an election under generally accepted accounting
principles for stock options has recorded no compensation cost for its stock
options in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Had compensation cost for stock options been determined based on the fair
value at the grant dates for awards under the plans, the Company's net income
and income per share would have been reduced to the proforma amounts disclosed
below:

</TABLE>

Proforma net income does not reflect options granted before April 1, 1995. 
Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation cost for stock options
is not reflected in the proforma  amounts presented above because compensation
cost is reflected over the options' vesting period of two years and compensa-
tion cost for options granted in the year ended March 31, 1995 are not consid-
ered for the year ended March 31, 1997.

The fair values were determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted average assumptions:

                                      1998             1997

During 1997, warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of common stock at $9.76 a
share were issued and remain outstanding at March 31, 1998.

11. Litigation:

In the normal course of business, there are various outstanding legal pro-
ceedings.  In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal
counsel, the consolidated financial statements of the Company will not be
materially affected by the outcome of such legal proceedings.

12. Year 2000:

The Company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely
impacted by Year 2000 software failures.  Software failures due to processing
errors potentially arising from calculations using the Year 2000 date are a
known risk.  The Company is addressing this risk to the availability and
integrity of financial systems and the reliability of operating systems.  The
Company has established processes for evaluating and managing the risks and
costs associated with this problem.  The total cost of compliance and its

<PAGE>
effect on the Company's future results of operations is being determined as
part of the detailed conversion planning.

     The Plan shall be administered by the Board or a Committee appointed by the
Board. If the Plan is administered by a Committee, the Committee shall

statement for obtaining Board approval of any action taken by the Committee in
carrying out the provisions of this Plan. If no Committee is appointed, the
entire Board shall constitute the Committee. Options to members of the Committee
may be granted only by a majority vote of the disinterested members of theBoard.
The Committee shall have full and final authority in its discretion, subject to
the provisions of the Plan and Board review, to determine the following:
     A.   The individuals to whom options shall be granted;
     B.   The time or times at which options shall be granted;
     C.   The number of shares covered by each option;
     D.   The purchase price of common stock covered by each option;


<PAGE>
     E.   The construction and interpretation of the Plan;
     F.   Subject to Section 6, to determine the terms and provisions of the

     H.   To take all other actions deemed necessary or advisable for the

     All such actions and determinations shall be conclusively binding for all

           SECTION 4.  COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO OPTIONS
     The initial aggregate number of shares of the Company's common stock which
may be issued upon the exercise of options granted under the Plan shall not

     Any option granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an agreement
executed by the Company and the Optionee, which agreement shall contain such
terms and be in such form as the Committee from time to time approves, subject
to the following limitations and conditions:
     A.   Option Price. The option price per share with respect to each Option
shall be determined by the Board, whether or not the Plan is administered by a
Committee, but in no instance shall the consideration for the price per share be
less than the par value of said stock;
     B.   Period of Option. The expiration date of each Option shall be fixed
by the Committee, but such expiration date shall not be more than ten (10) years
from the date of the grant;
     C.   Vesting of Shareholder's Rights. Neither an Optionee nor the
Optionee's successor shall have any of the rights of a shareholder of theCompany
until the certificates evidencing the shares purchased are properly delivered to
such Optionee or the Optionee's successor;
     D.   Exercise of Option. Each Option shall be exercisable from time to
time or over a period commencing on the Date of Grant and ending upon the
expiration or termination of the Option; provided, however, that the Committee
may, by the provisions of any Option Agreement, limit the number of shares
purchasable thereunder in any period or periods of time during which the Option
is exercisable;

<PAGE>
     E.   Nontransferrability of Option. Each Option shall be exercisable
during the Optionee's lifetime only by the Optionee. No Option shall be
transferrable or assignable by an Optionee, otherwise than by will or by thelaws
of descent and distribution. Except upon the written consent of the Committee
waiving this provision, the Option shall terminate and become null and void if
the Option is pledged or hypothecated in any way, or becomes subject to levy,
execution, attachment or similar process.
     F.   Termination of Employment. Unless otherwise provided in this Option
Plan, upon termination of an Optionee's employment with the Company or with any
of its subsidiaries, or in the case of a Director, ceases to be such, the
Optionee's option privilege shall be limited in the manner set forth in his/her
Option Agreement, or if not specified therein, to the shares which were
immediately purchasable by him/her at the date of such termination and such
option privileges shall expire unless exercised by the Optionee within thirty
(30) days after the date of such termination. The granting of an Option to an
eligible person does not alter in any way the Company's or a relevant
subsidiary's existing rights to terminate such person's employment at any time
for any reason, nor does it confer upon such person any rights or privileges
except as specifically provided for in the Plan;
     G.   Death of Optionee. If an Optionee dies while in the employ of the
Company or any subsidiary, the employee's option privileges shall be limited to
the shares which were immediately purchasable by the Optionee at the date of
death and such option privileges shall expire unless exercised by his successor
within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of Optionee's death.
                     SECTION 7.  ADJUSTMENTS
     A.   In the event that the outstanding shares of common stock of the
Company are hereafter increased or decreased, or changed into or exchanged for
a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company or
another corporation by reason of a recapitalization, reclassification, stock-
split, combination of shares, dividend or other distribution payable in capital
stock, appropriate adjustments shall be made by the Committee in the number and
kind of shares for the purchase of which Options may be granted under the Plan.
In addition, the Committee shall make appropriate adjustments in the number and
kind of shares as to which outstanding Options, or portions thereof then
unexercised, shall be exercisable, to the end that the proportionate interest of
the holder of the Option shall, to the extent practicable, be maintained as
before the occurrence of such event. Such adjustment in outstanding Optionsshall
be made without change in the total price applicable to the unexercised portion
of the Option but with a corresponding adjustment in the option price per share.
     B.   In the event of dissolution or liquidation of the Company, any Option
granted under the Plan shall terminate as of the date fixed by the Committee,
provided that not less than thirty (30) days written notice of the date so fixed
shall be given to each Optionee and each such Optionee shall have the right
during such period to exercise the Option as to all or any part of the shares
covered thereby, including shares as to which such Option would not otherwise be
exercisable by reason of an insufficient lapse of time.


<PAGE>
     C.   In the event of a reorganization in which the Company is not the
surviving or acquiring Company, or in which the Company is or becomes a wholly
owned subsidiary of another Company after the effective date of the
reorganization, then:
               (i)  If there is no plan or agreement respecting the
     reorganization, or if the reorganization agreement does not
     specifically provide for the change, conversion or exchange of the
     shares under outstanding and unexercised stock options for
     securities of another corporation, then the Option shall terminate;
     or
               (ii) If there is a reorganization agreement and the
     reorganization agreement specifically provides for the change,
     conversion or exchange of the shares under outstanding and
     unexercised stock options for securities of another corporation,
     then the Committee shall adjust the shares under such outstanding
     and unexercised stock options (and shall adjust the shares remaining
     under the Plan which are then available to be optioned under the
     Plan, if the reorganization agreement makes specific provisions
     therefore) in a manner not inconsistent with the provisions of the
     reorganization agreement for the adjustment, change, conversion or
     exchange of such stock and such options.
               (iii)     The term reorganization as used in this section shall
     mean any statutory merger, statutory consolidation, sale of all or
     substantially all of the assets of the Company, or sale, pursuant to
     an agreement with the Company, of securities of the Company pursuant
     to which the Company is or becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of
     another Company after the effective date of the reorganization.
     D.   Adjustments and determinations under this Section shall be made by
the Committee, whose decisions as to what adjustments or determination shall
be
made, and the extent thereof, shall be final, binding and conclusive.
            SECTION 8.  RESTRICTION ON ISSUING SHARES
     The exercise of each Option shall be subject to the condition that if at
any time the Company shall determine in its discretion that the satisfaction
of
withholding tax or other withholding liabilities, or that the listing,
registration, or qualification of any shares otherwise deliverable upon such
exercise upon any securities exchanged or under any state or federal law, or
that
the consent or approval of any regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a
condition of, or in connection with, such exercise of the delivery or purchase
of shares pursuant thereto, then in any such event, such exercise shall not be
effective unless such withholding, listing, registration, qualification,
consent,
or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not
acceptable to the Company.
    SECTION 9.  AMENDMENT, SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION OF PLAN
     The Board may at any time suspend or terminate the Plan or may amend it
from time to time in such respects as the Board may deem advisable in order
that
the Options granted hereunder may conform to any changes in the law or in any
other respect which the Board may deem to be in the best interests of the 

<PAGE>
Company; provided, however, that without approval by the shareholders of the
Company representing a majority of the voting power, no such amendment shall
except as provided in Section 4, increase the maximum number of shares for
which
Options may be granted under the Plan, (a) change the provisions of
subparagraph
A of Section 6 relating to the establishment of the option price, (b) change
the
provisions of subparagraph B of Section 6 relating to the expiration date of
each
Option, or (c) change the provisions of the next sentence of this Section 9
relating to the term of this Plan. Unless the Plan shall theretofore have been
terminated by the Board or as provided in Section 7, the Plan shall terminate
ten
(10) years after the effective date of the Plan. No Option may be granted
during
any suspension or after termination of the Plan. Except as provided in Section
7, no amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan shall, without the
Optionee's consent, alter or impair any of the rights or obligations under any
Option theretofore granted to such Optionee under the Plan.
   SECTION 10.  EFFECTIVE DATE OF PLAN AND SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL
     The effective date of the Plan is September 8, 1988, the date of its
approval by the Shareholders of the Company.
     Approved and accepted the 13th day of February, 1989.
