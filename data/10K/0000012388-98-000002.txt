ITEM 1.   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

DEFINITIONS

"Gravity" is a measure of the density of an oil. As defined in the petroleum
industry, a higher gravity corresponds to a lower density. Gravities of
crude oils range from about 12 degrees (heavy oil) to 60 degrees (distillate
or gasoline-like oil). Lower gravity oils are generally worth less, and they
may require unconventional technology to produce.

"Gross production" as used herein is defined as the total production of oil,
gas, or natural gas liquids from a property or group of properties, for any
gas, or natural gas liquids from a property or group of properties, for any
specified period of time.

Initial Potential ("IP") is a test performed before any significant
production from a well is marketed.  An oil well potential is an indication
of the maximum rate at which a well can produce. Usually, wells produce at
lower rates than their potentials.  Reasons for lower rates can involve
natural decline, government regulations, difficulties with operations or
infrastructure, and reservoir management considerations.

The term "overriding royalty" as used herein is defined as an interest carved
out of the lessee's leasehold or working interest. The amounts payable from
overriding royalties referred to in this Form 10K are payments calculated as a
percentage of either gross production or gross revenue from a concession or
lease, free and clear of all costs, except taxes.

The term "payout" is generally defined as a time when the total investment or
acquisition cost has been recaptured from revenues produced from the oil and
gas lease.

The term "royalty" is generally defined as a share of the production reserved
by the grantor of an oil or gas lease or concession. Customarily, the royalty
interest is free of cost or expense incident to exploration, development, or
production, except for production or gathering taxes.

"Spudded in" means that drilling on an oil or gas well has commenced.

The term "working interest" as used herein means all or a fractional part of
the ownership rights granted by a concession or lease. The working interest,
or a part thereof, pays all costs of operation and is entitled to the gross
production less royalties retained by the grantor or lessor and less other
royalties or non-operating interests created and assigned from the working
interest.

  (a)  GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

Black Giant Oil Company (the Company) was organized on July 23, 1973 as a
corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada, for the general purpose
of engaging in exploration for oil and gas. More recently, the Company has
shifted its activities to acquiring working interests, royalties, and
overriding royalties in oil and gas properties within the United States and
in foreign countries.

During its fiscal year ended March 31, 1997, the Company was not involved in
any bankruptcy, receivership, or similar proceeding and underwent no
material reclassification, merger, or consolidation. The Company does not
anticipate involvement or participation in any of the above proceedings.

During the period from April 1, 1978 to March 31, 1997, the Company
conducted no substantial business, received no material income and had no
material assets or liabilities.  The Company was dormant and virtually
inactive during this period of time.

In August 1997 a group of stockholders met and decided to make an attempt to
revive the Company and initiated a funding campaign.  The Company
successfully raised $95,000 through the issuance of 4,750,000 shares of
common stock.

  (b)  FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

The Company's oil and gas revenue is derived from Canadian royalties. The
Company continues to review shallow oil and gas plays in Texas, Oklahoma and
Kansas for acquisition. The Company acquired interests in twelve (12) leases
in Texas and Oklahoma subsequent to March 31, 1997. Negotiations continued
for additional oil and gas leases and prospects for drilling subsequent to
the year end.

  ( c ) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

The Company was seeking working capital during the years 1986 through 1990
to continue it operations; however, the collapse of the oil industry in
1986/87 caused funding programs for the Company to be unsuccessful.  The
lack of working capital eventually led the Company to become dormant.
During the years of being dormant various opportunities were presented to
the management to revive the Company.  Each opportunity was either not
favorable to the Company or was not able to close due to lack of financial
commitment or strength by the various interested parties.

Subsequent to March 31, 1997, a group of concerned shareholders met in
August to discuss the Company's future and outlined a plan to revive the
Company. The plan was to sell through private placements the Company's
common stock to raise operating capital to pay for the expense for the
Company to become current in its filings with the Securities Exchange
Commission and other government agencies. The private placement offering
price per share was $0.02. The Company successfully raised $95,000 from the
private placement program offered September through November 1997 which
represented 4,750,000 shares.

  COMPETITION AND MARKETS

The oil and gas industry is highly competitive in all of its phases, with
competition for favorable prospects being particularly intense.  The Company
believes that price, geological and geophysical skill, and familiarity with
an area of operations are the primary competitive factors in the acquisition
of desirable leases and suitable prospects for oil and gas drilling
operations.  The Company competes with independent operators and
occasionally major oil companies, a number of which have substantially
greater technical and financial resources than the Company.

States and countries and other jurisdictions in which the Company plans to
have operations, regulate the exploration, development, production and
prices on the sale of oil and gas. The Federal Power Commission regulates
the sale of natural gas production sold in interstate commerce and the U.S.
Government regulates the price on oil. Markets for, and value of, oil and
gas discovered are dependent on such factors as regulation, including well
spacing and production allowables, import quotes, competitive fuels, and
proximity of pipelines and price- fixing by governments, all of which are
beyond the control of the Company.

On March 31, 1997, 40 degree oil (good gravity crude) was selling for
approximately $19.25 per barrel, compared to a March 31, 1996 figure of
$19.75 per barrel. Prices also vary according to gravity. 

  FOREIGN TAXES AND UNITED STATES TAX CREDITS

The Company prior to March 31, 1997 did not have any operations outside of
the United States; however, the new management subsequent to March 31, 1997,
plans to work on international projects, primarily in Australia. In the
event operations abroad are established, then the Company will be subject to
the imposition of taxes by foreign governments upon the Company's income
derived from the respective foreign jurisdictions. Such taxes are of various
types, with differing tax rates, and are subject to changes. Generally, the
Company's income from a foreign jurisdiction will be taxed in the same
manner as that for other companies operating in the jurisdiction, but
discriminatory taxation by a particular jurisdiction may occur. 

The Company's income is also subject to taxation under the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The Code provides
that a taxpayer may obtain a tax credit for certain taxes paid to a foreign
country or may take a deduction for such taxes. A tax credit is generally
more favorable than a deduction. The tax credit applicable to particular
foreign income generally arises when such income is included in the
Company's taxable income under the provisions of the Code. There are,
however, substantial restrictions and limitations on the amount of the tax
credit that can actually be claimed.

  OTHER REGULATIONS

Oil and gas operations are and will be subject to federal, state and local
laws and regulations and by political developments. The domestic production
and sale of oil and gas are subject to federal regulation by the Department
of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulation Commission.  Rates of production
of oil and gas have for many years been subject to federal and state
conservation laws and regulations. In addition, oil and gas operations are
subject to extensive federal and state regulations concerning exploration,
development, production, transportation and pricing, and to interruption or
termination by governmental authorities.

In foreign countries, the Company may be subject to governmental
restrictions on production, pricing and export controls. Furthermore
regulations existing or imposed upon the Company at the time of its
acquisition of properties may change to an unpredictable extent.  The
Company will have little or no control over the change of regulations or
imposition of new regulations and restrictions by foreign governments,
ex-appropriation or nationalization by foreign governments or the imposition
of additional foreign taxes and partial foreign ownership requirements.

  PERSONNEL

The business of the Company has been carried on by Ivan Webb, President and
Elizabeth Webb, Secretary/Treasurer from April 1, 1987 through March 15,
1998. Ivan and Elizabeth Webb have devoted such time as has been necessary
to carry on the Company's business.  The Company has no bonus, pension, or
profit sharing plans.

Subsequent to year end (March 31, 1997) management initiated a funding
campaign from its existing shareholders to revive the Company. A meeting of
the shareholders planned for May 1998 will elect new directors. These
directors proposed by management are Ivan Webb, Richard M. Hewitt, Gifford
Dieterle and Herbert Wolas. 

During the month of September 1997 one part time employee was hired to
assist in the daily operations of the Company.
 
  ITEM 2.  DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY

The Company's assets on March 31, 1997 were $2,156 of which $327 is cash and
the balance is a Canadian royalty which is responsible for the oil and gas
revenues received by the Company.

The following is a description of each of the properties acquired by the
Company subsequent to March 31, 1997:

MOBIL FEE #4 - Black Giant took a 1% working interest in the drilling of a
major structure in Duval County, Texas in November 1997.  This well was
drilled to a total depth of 14,200 and encountered a very prolific gas
formation - 14,092 - 14,135 feet. The porosity ranges from 15 to 25% over
the zone. The well was put on line in January 1998 and is producing
approximately 10,000,000 cubic feet per day which yields to Black Giant's
interests approximately $3,200 per month in gas revenues representing a
payout of less than 10 months based on rate of production.

MOBIL FEE #5 - Black Giant exercised its option to take the same interest in
the offset well to the #4 well on February 24, 1998. On April 2, 1998 the
well was drilling ahead at 10,432 feet. Drilling began in March and it takes
about two months for the well to be drilled and about one month to put the
well on line.  The geology of this prospect is expected to be better than
the Mobil Fee #4.  Based on this information we can project monthly revenues
of $3,200 from this well for Black Giant.
 
MOBIL FEE ADDITIONAL ACREAGE - Black Giant has first rights on all other
wells to be drilled in the Mobil Fee Gas field.  Two more wells are planned
by year end.
 
THREE PRODUCING LEASES -  On September 30, 1997, the Company entered into a
Letter Agreement for the purchase of 10% working interest in three oil and
gas leases located in Nowata and Creek Counties of Oklahoma for 450,000
shares of common stock.  These leases total 1510 acres and have a total of
18 producing wells with additional wells to be reworked plus each lease has
its own saltwater disposal wells. The revenues from these leases are
expected to average $900 to $1,200 per month.

FOUR NON-PRODUCING LEASES - On September 30, 1997 the Company entered into a
Letter Agreement for the purchase of 50% working interest in four non
producing oil and gas leases in Oklahoma for development either through
drilling programs or farm outs retaining a carried interest.  The Company
agreed to issue 750,000 shares for these leases total 480 acres.  Drilling
is planned on these properties over the next 1 to 2 years.  It is planned
for Black Giant to recover its cost and keep a carried interest in each
lease as it is drilled.

WOOLDRIDGE LEASES - On October 15, 1997 the Company entered into an
agreement to acquire 90% of the working interest in two leases totaling 320
acres located in Shackelford County Texas for $21,000. These two leases have
a total of 11 wells plus 5 saltwater injection wells.  These wells are
producing approximately 4 barrels per day and are expected to increase to 6
barrels per day when changes are implemented in the production operations.
Payout on this acquisition is expected to occur within 30 months.
 
TROELL LEASES - On October 17, 1997 the Company entered into a ninety day
option agreement to acquire 50% working interest in an oil and gas lease in
Atascosa County, Texas for $58,000 in cash plus 136,000 shares of the
Company's common stock.  On February 18, 1998 the Company paid $18,000 on
this debt leaving a balance of $30,000. The option was renewed for another
90 day period. This 120 acre lease is expected to average 15 BOPD when 6
wells are put into production.  This lease is expected to be put into
production during the second quarter of 1998. Estimated revenues are
projected to be $2,700 per month.
 
 SPIRES LEASE - On October 20, 1997 the Company entered into an agreement to
 acquire 40% working interest in 160 acre oil and gas lease in Nolan County,
 Texas for $15,000 plus 250,000 shares of common stock and settle certain
 account payables related to the lease.  This lease is expected to average
 18-20 barrels per day from a single well and is expected to be put on line
 during the second quarter of 1998. Estimated revenues are projected to be
 $2,100 per month.


  ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

As of April 14, 1998, there were no legal proceedings to which the Company
was a party, and no legal litigation is known to be pending.


  ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITIES HOLDERS

No matters have been submitted to a vote of security holders during the
dormant period from 1987 through 1998.  A shareholder meeting is planned
during the month of May 15, 1998 in light of the recent developments that
have caused the Company to be revived with new assets.

c)  DIVIDEND INFORMATION

The Company has not declared or paid dividends in the past, and does not
anticipate doing so in the immediate future.


  ITEM 6.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATIONS

  GENERAL DISCUSSION:

Following the Company's fiscal year ended March 31, 1987, the Company
continued to have difficulty in raising working and operating capital. The
environment for energy deals was very tough as oil prices continue to fall
to $9.50 per barrel. The oil and gas revenues had fallen to less than
$25,000 per year which was less than half of the previous years revenues.
The Company had liabilities of approximately $143,000 which led the Company
to sell the majority of its assets primarily its oil and gas production to
reduce debt. The Company gradually became less active and by 1991 it was
virtually inactive and dormant. The Company made presentations a number of
times each year to prospective merger candidates.  Each of these attempts
never materialized either due to financing problems or lack of working
capital to made the merger successful.

Subsequent to March 31, 1997, a group of concerned shareholders met in
August to discuss the Company's future and outlined a plan to revive the
Company. The plan was to sell private placements of the Company's common
stock to raise operating capital to pay for the expense for the Company to
become current in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and other government agencies. The private placement offering price per
share was $0.02. The Company successfully raised $95,000 from the private
placement program offered September through November 1997.

The Company proceeded to bring the Company back into compliance with the
various government agencies by bringing current the corporation fees in
Nevada, engaging a Tax Accountant to prepare the tax returns for the
delinquent years and prepare the financial statements for audit for the
three years ended March 31, 1995, 1996, and 1997.

  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:

The Company's assets as of March 31, 1997 were $2,156 representing only a
small Canadian royalty interest and $327 in cash. As previously stated most
of the assets of the Company were sold to reduce debt.

The principal assets of the Company were considered to be its shareholder
base, approximately 1,900, and the fact that it had only $13,067 in total
debt. This, in the opinion of management, was valuable and was worth keeping
alive until a plan of action could be implemented to cause the Company to be
revived.

The assets of the Company for March 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997 have remained
fairly constant except for March 31, 1996 when the cash balance was higher
due to an attempt to merge with a Dallas based company.

The liabilities have gradually declined from $24,477 on March 31, 1995 to
$13,067 for March 31, 1997. These liabilities were paid from revenues
received from the Canadian royalty. These debts are principally due to
accounts payable for accounting and legal services.

  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:

The $7,293 revenues for 1995 are from the Canadian royalty which is paid in
Canadian dollars. The expense of $2,453 for Foreign Exchange is directly
related to the conversion of the Canadian dollar to United States dollars.
No other revenues were received during the year and the remaining
expenditures were nominal except for $2,225 paid for professional fees.

The fiscal year ended March 31, 1996 included an effort to revive the
Company. In addition to the oil and gas revenues of $8,658, the Company
entered into an agreement with a Dallas based company where they would fund
the cost of bringing the Company current with all of the various government
agencies. The Dallas group provided $35,000 for the revival process,
however, the funds were never used for bringing the Company current. The
Dallas group decided for the Company to take a $10,000 option on a
12,900,000 acre oil and gas concession located in the western part of
Queensland, Australia. The option was never exercised and the option
expired. The Dallas group required $20,000 for another project and failed to
return these funds back to the Company, causing the Company to discontinue
its process of becoming current with its filings. The Company did profit
from the transaction with the Dallas group by approximately $5,000 which was
beneficial to pay on the Company's debt.

The fiscal year ended March 31, 1997 reflects an increase in revenues from
the Company's royalties plus miscellaneous income of $11,875. This
miscellaneous income was derived from coordinating a printing and mailing
job for a public company. The expenses of the Company increased to $24,728
of which $16,078 was paid for contract services which was primarily paid for
printing and mailing services. 

The Company reported a profit each of the past three years ended March 31,
1995, 1996 and 1997. These profits were small, representing less than one
cent per share in earnings per share. The Company has 14,350,227 shares
issued and outstanding for each of the three years presented.

  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS:

On September 22, 1997, the Company entered into a Debt Agreement with the
Wolas Family for $100,000. The terms of the Debt Agreement are 10% interest
payable in stock on a quarterly basis (125,000 shares per quarter - based on
2 cents per share). The debt can be paid in full or be convertible to
equity, based on 2 cents per share (5,000,000 shares - on the 22nd of
September, 2000 at the election of the Wolas Family). The Wolas Family also
have a warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock for $25,000 on
or before the 22nd of September 2002, being $0.025 per share.

During the process of reviving the Company, the Company participated in the
drilling of three wells and purchased working interests in 12 oil and gas
lease. These leases have a total of 78 wells of which 33 are producing, 30
are non producing and 15 are disposal wells for saltwater. The interests
range from 1% to 50%. These oil and gas leases are located in Texas and
Oklahoma. As of March 31, 1998 no oil and gas revenues have been received by
the Company from these leases, however, management expects oil and gas
revenues to begin in April/May 1998. See "Item 2. Description of Property"
for more information about these properties.

In general, the Company has been able to attract working and operating
capital to cause the Company to regain its full reporting status and build
oil and gas income. The Company, after regaining its full reporting status,
will have the opportunity to secure financing from several sources to
further build the Company. Currently, there are three main groups that are
interested in financing the Company.

"Year 2000" problem is the result of computer programs being written using two
digits rather than four to define the applicable year.  Any programs that have
time-sensitive software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900
rather than the year 2000.  This could result in a major system failure or
miscalculations.  The Company believes that all of its software and equipment
is "Year 2000" compliant and that this problem will have no affect on the
Company's operations.

                           BLACK GIANT OIL COMPANY
                        NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              For the Years Ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS -    Black Giant Oil Company (the
Company) was organized on July 23, 1973 as a corporation under the laws of the
State of Nevada, for the general purpose of engaging in exploration for oil
and gas.  More recently, the Company has shifted its activities to acquiring
working interests, royalties, and overriding royalties in oil and gas
properties within the United States and in foreign countries.
 
During its fiscal year ended March 31, 1997, the Company was not involved in
any bankruptcy, receivership, or similar proceeding and under went no material
reclassification, merger, or consolidation.  The Company does not anticipate
involvement or participation in any of the above proceedings.

During the period from April 1, 1978 to March 31, 1997, the Company conducted
no substantial business, received no material income and had no material
assets or liabilities.  The Company was dormant and virtually inactive during
this period of time.
 
In August 1997, a group of stockholders met and decided to make an attempt to
revive the Company and initiated a funding campaign.  Although a public
company reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under
Section 13D or 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, its last report on Form 10-K
was for the Company's fiscal year ended March 31, 1987 until renewed activity
on the Company's behalf by its Board of Directors during the fiscal year 1997.
The Company intends to bring all necessary filings with the SEC current during
1998.
 
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed in the
preparation of these consolidated financial statements.  The financial
statements and notes are the representation of the Company's Management, who
is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.  The policies conform to
generally accepted accounting principles and have been consistently applied.

USE OF ESTIMATES -  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT -   Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Producing Royalties are stated at cost.  Depletion is computed at 15% of gross
income up to the acquisition cost of the individual royalty holdings.  Costs
of maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.  Major
improvements and renewals, in general, are capitalized.  Acquisitions to fixed
assets are depreciated on the straight-line method, generally over lives of
5-7 years. 
 
Depreciation and depletion charged against operations for the years ended
March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 were $2,379, $1,401 and $1,196, respectively. 
 
The Company, as activity increases, intends to use the successful efforts
method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities.  Under this
method, all costs associated with productive exploratory wells and productive
or nonproductive development wells will be capitalized while the costs of
nonproductive exploratory wells are expensed.  Indirect exploratory
expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, will be
expensed as incurred.  Unproved properties will be assessed periodically, and
if an impairment of value is apparent, a valuation allowance will be provided.
Capitalized costs relating to proved properties will be amortized using the
units of production method on a property-by-property basis.  Generally, no
gain or loss will be recognized upon disposition of proved oil and gas
properties unless the disposition encompasses an entire property.

NOTE 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

As of March 31, 1997, there were no legal proceedings to which the Company was
a party, and no legal litigation is known to be pending.

NOTE 4 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In August 1997, a group of concerned shareholders met to discuss the Company's
future and outlined a plan to revive the Company.  The plan was to sell
through private placements the Company's common stock to raise operating
capital to pay for the expense for the Company to become current in its
filings with the Securities Exchange commission and other government agencies.
The private placement offering price per share was $0.02.  The Company
successfully raised $95,000 from the private placement program offered during
September through November 1997.
 
The Company proceeded to bring the Company back into compliance with the
various government agencies by engaging a Tax Accountant to prepare the tax
returns for the delinquent years and prepare the financial statements for
audit for the three years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995.
 
On September 22, 1997, the Company entered into a Debt Agreement with the
Wolas Family for $100,000.  The terms of the Debt Agreement are 10% interest
payable in stock on a quarterly basis (125,000 shares per quarter - based on 2
cents per share).  The debt can be paid in full or be convertible to equity,
based on 2 cents per share (5,000,000 shares - on the 22nd of September, 2000
at the election of the Wolas Family.  The Wolas Family also have a warrant to
purchase 1,000,000 share of common stock for $25,000 on or before the 22nd of
September 2002, being $0.025 per share.
 
During the process of reviving the Company, the Company participated in the
drilling of three wells, purchased working interests in 12 oil and gas leases.
These leases have a total of 78 wells of which 33 are producing, 30 are
non-producing and 15 are disposal wells for saltwater.  The interests range
from 1% to 50%.  These oil and gas leases are located in Texas and Oklahoma.
As of March 31, 1998, no oil and gas revenues have been received by the
Company from these leases, however, management expects oil and gas revenues to
begin in April 1998.
