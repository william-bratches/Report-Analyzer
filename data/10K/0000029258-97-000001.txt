DESCRIPTION AND LINES OF BUSINESS


Diversified Realty, Inc. (herein referred to as "DRI" or the "Company") is a 
majority-owned subsidiary of M Corp, a financial holding company.  As of 
December 31, 1996, M Corp owned approximately eighty-four percent of the 
outstanding common stock of the Company.

For the past several years, the Company has been primarily engaged in the 
ownership and rental of real property.  As of December 31, 1996, DRI owned 
property in Florida and Montana.

Information as of December 31, 1996, concerning the gross carrying amount of 
real property, accumulated depreciation and encumbrances on a property by 
property basis is presented in Note 8, Investments in Real Estate, of the 
Notes to Financial Statements.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net income decreased $44,867 (117.7%) in 1996 as compared with 1995.  The 
decrease in net income in 1996 as compared with 1995 was due in part to an
decrease in revenues and in part to a increase in expenses.

Rent income decreased $3,161 (4.2%) in 1996 as compared with 1995 due 
primarily to economic conditions.  Interest income decreased $23,653(41.8%) 
in 1996 as compared with 1995.  The decrease in interest income in 1996 as 
compared with 1995 was due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest
charged by the Company to its parent company. During 1995 the Company charged

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUED

its parent company interest in the amount of $27,031. The Company's parent
company repaid substantially all advances it had owed to the Company
and as a result the Company did not charge the parent company interest during
1996. Transactions with the Company's parent company and its affiliates 
during 1996 and 1995 are disclosed in Note 6, Related Party Transactions, of 
the Notes to Financial Statements.

Operating expenses in total, increased $28,478 (38.7%) in 1996 as compared 
with 1995.  Maintenance expenses increased $19,298 (75.0%) in 1996 as 
compared with 1995 due primarily to increases in maintenance costs.  The 
provision for depreciation decreased $2,314 (11.1%) in 1996 as compared with
1995 due to some of the Company's assets being fully depreciated during 1996
and 1995.

Income tax expense decreased $10,450 (52.3%) in 1996 as compared with 1995 
due to the decrease in pre-tax income.  The Company files a consolidated 
income tax return with the Company's parent company and other affiliated 
companies.

Although there are no present plans with respect thereto, the Company is 
involved in an ongoing basis in examining and investigating investment 
opportunities available to the Company which could possibly result in a 
change in the liquidity of the Company.  The Company knows of no existing 
trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties not otherwise mentioned 
herein that could result in a material change in the Company's liquidity.
The Company knows of no material trends, favorable or unfavorable, 
in the Company's capital resources.

                     	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Nature of Operations, Risks and Uncertainties

The Company is engaged in the ownership and rental of properties located
primarily in Yellowstone County, Montana.

The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of certain types of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled 
transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

(b)	Depreciation

Depreciation for the various classifications of rental property, plant and 
equipment is computed using the straight-line and accelerated methods over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings						                           15 - 27 Years
Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment	         3 - 10 Years

(c)	Income Taxes

The Company files a consolidated income tax return with its parent company.  
Income taxes are allocated to the Company based upon the ratio of the 
Company's pre-tax income to total consolidated pre-tax income.

(d)	Policy of Cash Equivalents

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents include time 
deposits, certificates of deposit and money market accounts, all with original 
maturities of three months or less.

(e) Earnings Per Share

The computation of earnings per share in the accompanying statements is based
on the weighted average number of shares outstanding, as follows:

   Year Ended December 31, 1996 - 1,873,923 shares
   Year Ended December 31, 1995 - 1,875,000 shares

(f)	Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts to 	make 
them comparable to the 1996 presentation. These changes had no	impact on 
previously reported results of operations or shareholders'	equity.

2.  	CASH BALANCES

The Company maintains accounts with various stock brokerage firms.  The 
accounts contain cash and securities.  Cash balances are insured up to 
$100,000 by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SIPC").  
At December 31, 1996, a cash balance totalling $732,575 was uninsured by the 
SIPC.

3. 	INVESTMENT SECURITIES

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 
("SFAS 115"), "Accounting For Investments in Certain Debt and Equity 
Securities" effective January 1, 1994.  In accordance with SFAS No. 115, the 
Company has classified its investment as a trading security at December 31,
1995.  

The statements of income for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 
contain net realized gains or losses on the disposition of investment 
securities in the amounts of $(228). and $0, respectively, and contain a
provision for unrealized gains or losses in the amounts of $244 and $0,
respectively.

4.  CONTRACT RECEIVABLE

The contract receivable at December 31 consists of the following:

                                                   1996              1995    
9% Contract For Deed, due in monthly
 installments of $248 including interest to
 September, 2002                               $  13,317         $   15,019  
 

Less Current Portion                               1,854              1,703  

Long-Term Contract Receivable                  $  11,463          $  13,316  
                                                  
The above contract receivable is secured by real property, the sale of which 
resulted in the receivable.  In the event the receivable becomes uncollectible 
and the underlying collateral is completely worthless, the Company would 
incur a loss in the amount of the receivable.

5.	INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense consists of the following, all currently payable:

                                                     1996           1995   

U.S. Income Taxes                                $  (3,200)     $  19,950  

State Income Taxes                                  12,750             50  

                                                 $   9,550      $  20,000  


The income tax expense reflected in the financial statements differs from the
amounts that would normally be expected by applying the U.S. Federal income 
tax rates to income before income taxes.  The reasons for these differences 
are as follows:

    						                                              1996         1995

7. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating
its fair value disclosure for financial instruments. The carrying amounts
reported in the balance sheet for cash and the receivable from the Company's
parent company approximate those assets' fair value. Fair value for investment
securities is based on quoted market prices. The Company believes that the 
fair value of its contract receivable, which has a stated interest rate of 
9.0 %, approximates carrying value due to the credit risk involved.
