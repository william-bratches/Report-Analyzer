PART 1

ITEM 1.  Business

  Registrant was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on July
12, 1922, under the name of California Copper Corporation, as a holding company
for the shares of its operating company, Engels Copper Mining Company which was
incorporated under the laws of the State of California on June 19, 1901.
Engels Copper Mining Company was merged into California Copper Corporation on
March 3, 1936, and the name of the merged company was changed to California-
Engels Mining Company.  Exploration and development commenced at the Engels
Mine, Lights Creek Mining District, Plumas County, California, upon
organization of Engels Copper Mining Company; but it was not until 1914 that
milling facilities were available and actual production of copper started.
From 1914 until operations were suspended due to the low price of copper in
July, 1930, approximately 4,700,000 tons of ore were mined from the Engels and
Superior mines and milled producing 160,170,000 pounds of copper and
substantial values in gold and silver.  Out of profits of this operation, the
Registrant retired a bond issue of $500,000 and paid out more than $1,285,000
in dividends.  During the 1930's the mining and milling plant, Engelmine
townsite and the Indian Valley Railroad subsidiary were dismantled and sold.

  Registrant's mining properties were continuously leased from September, 1947,
to March, 1951; from March, 1951, to December, 1959; from November, 1960, to
October, 1979; from August, 1980, to August, 1990; and from November, 1990, to
April 1993.  The lessee from 1964 to 1993 was Placer Dome U.S. Inc., the U.S.
subsidiary of Placer Dome Inc., Vancouver, B.C., Canada.  The Mining Lease With
Option to Purchase, between the Registrant (Lessor) and Placer Dome U.S. Inc.
(Lessee) was terminated by Placer Dome U.S. Inc. effective April 20, 1993.
Registrant has received a substantial amount of technical data on its mining
properties and maintains a library on the Plumas Copper Belt.

  During the 1960's and 1970's Placer Dome U.S. Inc. conducted an exploration
and development program on Registrant's Superior Mine, Sulphide Ridge property
and Engels Mine. They identified two large porphyry-type copper bearing zones
in the Superior Mine and on Sulphide Ridge. The Engels Mine was also estimated
to contain copper mineralization amenable to bulk mining methods. Other
exploration targets remain to be tested including an intensely sheared area in
the quartz monzonite southeast of the Superior Mine and north of Superior
Ridge, the Quigley Prospect, the area between the Superior and  Engels mines in
the quartz monzonite near its contact with the coarse grained granite, along the
main fault zone and the metavolcanic, quartz diorite, gabbro contact northeast
of the Engels Mine and an indicated quartz monzonite intrusive beneath the
Engels Mine where a deep ore system could be found. These deposits and
prospects were not deemed economically attractive for many years. However in
response to a projected global shortage of copper and higher prices, interest
has renewed in the geologically unique Lights Creek Mining District.

  The Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan on Registrant's mining properties
was approved by the California Department of Forestry and became effective
July 2, 1999.  The permitting process for this project began in August, 1994
with the start of the archaeological survey and the February, 1995 agreement
with Shasta Land Management Consultants to prepare the Plan.

  The Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan is an assessment of the timber
inventory, conditions and potential of the entire property broken down into
units with similar growing conditions within each unit.  Its intent is to
demonstrate a long-term commitment to appropriately manage the resource.  It
functions as a coordinated collection of individual Timber Harvest Plans and
its advantage is that, once approved, the paperwork necessary to initiate
individual timber harvests is minimal.  Under the Plan Registrant is
restricted in management options to those silvicultural systems that produce
uneven-aged stands of timber.  Uneven-aged management means the management of
a specific forest with the goal of establishing a well-stocked stand of various
age classes of trees scattered over the forest.  It will permit the periodic
harvest of all size classes as individual or small groups to realize yield.
Over the long term, forest growth and yield will be balanced.  The Registrant
will also have the advantage of being able to time harvests for favorable
market conditions.  It will take a number of years to fully implement the Plan.

  After the effective date of the Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan the
Registrant filed a Notice of Timber Operations for a helicopter harvest on its
Green Ledge and Austrian Syndicate parcels on Ward Creek pursuant to the Plan.
The project harvested 377,520 board feet of timber and was completed on October
28, 1999.

  Registrant made application to the California Tree Farm Committee of the
American Tree Farm System for approval of its Engelmine Forest timber lands on
Lights Creek as a tree farm.  Its Engelmine Forest was accepted as California
Tree Farm No. 2611 on June 17, 1999.

  Registrant received approval on July 28, 2000 for a 103 acre hand thinning
project from the California Department of Forestry pursuant to their California
Forest Improvement Program.  The Department reimbursed 75% of the cost to the
Registrant over the three year life of the agreement.  Other hand thinning
projects funded by the Registrant are ongoing on other overstocked areas of its
property.

  Registrant filed a Notice of Timber Operations pursuant to its Non-Industrial
Timber Management Plan on September 7th and December 15, 2000, for mechanical
thinning and chipping/biomass projects on its Engels and Smith parcels.  A
Timber Harvest Plan was filed for its Henry parcel on November 27, 2000.
Thinning began on December 11, 2000, by Pew Forest Products, Crescent Mills,
California using two Timbco feller buncher machines, a stroke delimber, shovel
loader, chipper, logging trucks and other equipment.  The thinning and timber
harvest completed on July 13, 2001, produced 1,432,000 board feet of small logs
generating sufficient funds to pay for the projects.  The purpose of the
thinning harvest was to reduce fire danger, improve the timber stand, provide
wildlife protection, remove hazard timber and improve aesthetics.

  The U.S.D.A. Forest Service approved its Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment
on January 21, 2004 and affirmed it after appeals on November 18, 2004.  The
plan will activate the Herger-Feinstein Quincy Library Group (HFQLG) pilot
project on the Plumas National Forest.  If the HFQLG is implemented it will
result in surface ladder fuels thinning to reduce the extent and severity of
wildland fires in the National Forest surrounding Registrant's property.

  Registrant is subject to a State of California General Industrial Activities
Storm Water Permit.  During the year, pursuant to the Registrant's Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan, catch and evaporation basins and monthly water
sampling records were maintained.

ITEM 2.  Properties

      (a)  Registrant is the fee owner of 36 patented lode mining claims
totaling 736 acres, plus 239.24 acres of other patented lands at Engelmine,
Lights Creek Mining District, Plumas County, California. During the year
Registrant sold 6.04 acres of land for $80,000 carrying back a Deed of Trust.
None of the claims or patented lands are subject to any encumbrance.

      (b)  Registrant is the fee owner of five patented lode mining claims
totaling 100 acres in the Genesee Mining District, Plumas County, California.
None of the claims are subject to any encumbrance.

ITEM 3.  Legal Proceedings

      None

ITEM 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

ITEM 5.  Market for the Registrant's Capital Stock and Related
         Shareholder Matters

      (a)  Principal Markets.

  Registrant's shares of Capital Stock are quoted on the Over-the-Counter
Market in the "pink sheets" which are published daily by the Pink Sheets LLC
under the symbol "CAEN".

  The following table shows the high and low bid prices of Registrant's Capital
Shares in the Over-the-Counter Market for the past two years:

        $ 1.05

     (b)  Approximate number of holders of capital stock.
  The approximate number of holders of record of Registrant's Capital Stock as
of March 24, 2006 is 711.

     (c)  Registrant has not paid a dividend on its Capital Stock because it
has had an accumulated deficit since the merger in 1936.  The Board of
Directors of the Registrant is endeavoring to earn income from the sale of
timber, sale of land, sale of sand and rock and its bookkeeping business so
funds are available for the maintenance of its mining properties and the
implementation of its timber management plan.  It is not the intention of the
Registrant to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.

ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

      (a)  Financial condition, changes in financial condition and results
of operations.

  During the 30 years its mining properties were leased, the Board of
Directors of the Registrant endeavored to increase working capital, total
assets and shareholder's equity in the event that its lessee, Placer Dome U.S.
Inc., terminated its Mining Lease With Option to Purchase agreement and return
the mining properties to the Registrant.  This event occurred effective April
20, 1993.  Thus funds were available to begin preparation of the Non-Industrial
Timber Management Plan.  Because timber and land sale revenues are infrequent,
in order to provide regular monthly income the President of the Registrant, on
January 1, 2000, transferred his bookkeeping business to the Registrant.
Changes in working capital, total assets and shareholder's equity for the past
five years are summarized as follows:

  The objective of the Board of Directors of the Registrant is to earn income
from the sale of timber, sale of land, sale of sand and rock, and its
bookkeeping business so funds are available for the maintenance of its mining
properties and the implementation of its Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan.

      (b)  Results of operations.

  Registrant's principal sources of income are from the sale of timber, sale of
land, sale of sand and rock, bookkeeping business, interest and dividends.
There is no assurance that any of the sources of income will continue at
current rates into the future.  The termination of the Mining Lease With
Option to Purchase agreement substantially increased Registrant's property
maintenance expenses.

ITEM 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

filing of unaudited statements of inactive registrants are listed in the index
to financial statements and schedules, and are included under PART IV, Item 14,

objectivity.  These accounting policies conform to Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles and have been consistently applied in the preparation of

properties.  The principal revenue sources currently consist of timber, land
and rock sales, bookkeeping business, and investment income. The Company's
properties are located in the western United States.

Estimates

NOTE 4 - VALUATION OF MINERAL LANDS - DEFERRED INCOME TAXES

  The Mineral lands carried on the books at a value of $10,000 less depletion
have a historical cost basis from June 19, 1901 of $1,000,000.  Beginning in
1913, different valuations were placed on these lands by the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue.  Under instructions of the Commissioner, the values of the
land were written up on the books to a high of $4,500,000 on February 23, 1928.

  In 1934, because of depressed conditions, the mineral lands were written
down to $10,000 without any tax benefit.  In the event of a sale of these lands
the recognized gain for tax purposes will be substantially reduced or
eliminated.  Consequently a deferred tax asset of approximately $340,000 has
been offset by a corresponding valuation allowance of approximately $340,000
due to the unlikelihood of the sale of the property in the near future.

  It is estimated that the current market value of the properties meets or
exceeds the $1,000,000 historical cost basis; however, due to the length of
time the Company has reported the land values at the written down value of
$10,000, a change to the cost method has not been deemed appropriate for
reporting purposes.
