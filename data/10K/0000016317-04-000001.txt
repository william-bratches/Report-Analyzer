PART 1

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

   Registrant was incorporated under the laws of the State of
California on July 12, 1922, under the name of California Copper
Corporation, as a holding company for the shares of its operating
company Engels Copper Mining Company which was incorporated under
the laws of the State of California on June 19, 1901.  Engels
Copper Mining Company was merged into California Copper Corporation
on March 3, 1936, and the name of the merged company was changed to
California-Engels Mining Company.  Exploration and development
commenced at the Engels Mine, Lights Creek Mining District, Plumas
County, California, upon organization of Engels Copper Mining
Company; but it was not until 1914 that milling facilities were
available and actual production of copper started.  From 1914 until
operations were suspended due to the low price of copper in July,
1930, approximately 4,700,000 tons of ore were mined from the
Engels and Superior mines and milled producing 160,170,000 pounds
of copper and substantial values in gold and silver.  Out of
profits of this operation, the Registrant retired a bond issue of
$500,000 and paid out more than $1,285,000 in dividends.  During
the 1930's the mining and milling plant, Engelmine townsite and the
Indian Valley Railroad subsidiary were dismantled and sold.

   Registrant's mining properties were continuously leased from
September, 1947, to March, 1951; from March, 1951, to December,
1959; from November, 1960, to October, 1979; from August, 1980, to
August, 1990; and from November, 1990, to April 1993.  The lessee
from 1964 to 1993 was Placer Dome U.S. Inc., the U.S. Subsidiary of
Placer Dome Inc., Vancouver, B.C., Canada.  The Mining Lease With
Option to Purchase, between the Registrant (Lessor) and Placer Dome
U.S. Inc. (Lessee) was terminated by Placer Dome U.S. Inc.
effective April 20, 1993.  Registrant has received a substantial
amount of technical data on its mining properties and maintains a
library on the Plumas Copper Belt.  Thousands of feet of drill core
from the Superior Mine, Sulphide Ridge and the Engels Mine are
stored at Crescent Mills, California.  Registrant's mineral
deposits and prospects are not deemed economically attractive under
current conditions for the mining industry in California and the
United States, nor are they likely to be so in the foreseeable future.

   The Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan on Registrant's mining
properties was approved by the California Department of Forestry
and became effective July 2, 1999.  The permitting process for this
project began in August, 1994 with the start of the archaeological
survey and the February, 1995 agreement with Shasta Land
Management Consultants to prepare the Plan.

     The Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan is an assessment of
the timber inventory, conditions and potential of the entire
<page>
property broken down into units with similar growing conditions
within each unit.  Its intent is to demonstrate a long-term
commitment to appropriately manage the resource.  It functions as
a coordinated collection of individual Timber Harvest Plans and its
advantage is that, once approved, the paperwork necessary to
initiate individual timber harvests is minimal.  Under the Plan the
Registrant is restricted in management options to those
silvicultural systems that produce uneven-aged stands of timber.
Uneven-aged management means the management of a specific forest
with the goal of establishing a well-stocked stand of various age
classes of trees scattered over the forest.  It will permit the
periodic harvest of all size classes as individual or small groups
to realize yield.  Over the long term, forest growth and yield will
be balanced.  The Registrant will also have the advantage of
being able to time harvests for favorable market conditions.  It will
take a number of years to fully implement the Plan.

     After the effective date of the Non-Industrial Timber
Management Plan the Registrant filed a Notice of Timber Operations
for a helicopter harvest on its Green Ledge and Austrian Syndicate
parcels on Ward Creek pursuant to the Plan.  The project harvested
377,520 board feet of timber and was completed on October 28, 1999.

     Registrant made application to the California Tree Farm
Committee of the American Tree Farm System for approval of its
Engelmine Forest timber lands on Lights Creek as a tree farm.  Its
Engelmine Forest was accepted as California Tree Farm No. 2611 on
June 17, 1999.

     Registrant received approval on July 28, 2000 for a 103 acre
hand thinning project from the California Department of Forestry
pursuant to their California Forest Improvement Program.  The
Department reimbursed 75% of the cost to the Registrantover the
three year life of the agreement. Other hand thinning projects
funded by the Registrant are ongoing on other overstocked
areas of its property.

     Registrant filed a Notice of Timber Operations pursuant to its
Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan on September 7th and December
15, 2000, for mechanical thinning and chipping/biomass projects on its
Engels and Smith parcels.  A Timber Harvest Plan was filed for
its Henry parcel on November 27, 2000.  Thinning began on December
11, 2000 by Pew Forest Products, Crescent Mills, California using
two Timbco feller buncher machines, a stroke delimber, shovel
loader, chipper, logging trucks and other equipment.  The thinning
and timber harvest completed on July 13, 2001, products 1,432,000
board feet of small logs generating sufficient funds to pay for the
projects.  The purpose of the thinning harvest was to reduce fire
danger, improve the timber stand, provide wildlife protection,
remove hazard timber and improve aesthetics.

<page>
     The U.S.D.A. Forest Service approved its Sierra Nevada Forest
Plan Amendment Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on
January 21, 2004. The plan will activate the Herger-Feinstein Quincy
Library Group (HFQLG) pilot project on the Plumas National Forest.  If
the HFQLG is implemented it will result in surface ladder fuels
thinning to reduce the extent and severity of wildland fires in
the National Forest surrounding Registrant's property.


     Registrant is subject to a State of California General
Industrial Activities Storm Water Permit.  During the year,
pursuant to the Registrant's Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan,
catch and evaporation basins and monthly water sampling records
were maintained.

earn income from the sale of timber, sale of land, sale of sand and
rock and its bookkeeping business so funds are available for the
maintenance of its mining properties and the implementation of its
Timber Management Plan.  It is not the intention of the Registrant
to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   (a)  Financial condition, changes in financial condition and
results of operations.

<page>
   During the 30 years its mining properties were leased, the Board
of Directors of the Registrant endeavored to increase working
capital, total assets and shareholder's equity in the event that
its lessee, Placer Dome U.S. Inc., terminated its Mining Lease
With Option to Purchase agreement and return the mining properties
to the Registrant.  This event occurred effective April 20, 1993.
Thus funds were available to begin preparation of the Non-Industrial
Timber Management Plan.  Because timber and land sale revenues are
infrequent, in order to provide regular monthly income the
President of the Registrant, on January 1, 2000, transferred
his bookkeeping business to the Registrant.  Changes in working
capital, total assets and shareholder's equity for the past five
years are summarized as follows:

<table>

</table>

   The objective of the Board of Directors of the Registrant is to
earn income from the sale of timber, sale of land, sale of sand and
rock and its bookkeeping business so that funds are available for
the maintenance of its mining properties and the implementation of
its Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan.

  (b)  Results of operations.

   Registrant's principal sources of income are from the sale of
timber, sale of land, sale of sand and rock, bookkeeping business,
interest and dividends.  There is no assurance that any of the sources
of income will continue at current rates into the future. The termination
of the Mining Lease With Option to Purchase agreement substantially
increased Registrant's property maintenance expenses.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2003

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  This summary of significant accounting policies of California-Engels
Mining Company (the Company) is presented to assist in understanding
the Company's financial statements.  The financial statements and
notes are representations of the Company's management who is
responsible for their integrity and objectivity.  These accounting
policies conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and have
been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.

Nature of Activity

  The Company's principal line of business is development of
mineral and timber properties.  The principal revenue sources
currently consist of timber, land and rock sales, bookkeeping
business, and investment income. The Company's properties are
located in the western United States.

Estimates

  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts
and disclosures.  Accordingly, actual results could differ from
these estimates.

Basis of Accounting

  The Company's books are maintained on the accrual method of
accounting.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

  For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company
considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a purchased maturity
of three months of less to be cash equivalents.

Concentration of Credit Risk

  The Company places its temporary cash investments with financial
institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
financial institution.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2003

Mineral and Timber Lands

  Mineral and timber lands and depreciable property are stated at book value
less accumulated depletion and depreciation.  Depreciation is calculated
using the declining balance method over five to seven years.  Timber
depletion is calculated based on units of production.

Comprehensive Income

  Pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No.
130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, the Company reports any material
components of comprehensive income in its financial statements.

Reclassification

  Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the current years financial statement
presentation.  Such reclassification had no effect on net equity or
net income.

NOTE 3 - MINING CLAIMS AND FEE LAND OWNED

   At December 31, 2003, the Company was the owner of 36 patented
lode mining claims totaling 736 acres comprising the Engels and
Superior Mines and 245.28 acres of patented land at Engelmine,
Lights Creek Mining District, Plumas County, California.

   At December 31, 2003, the Company was the owner of five patented
lode mining claims totaling 100 acres on Ward Creek in the Genesee
Mining District, Plumas County, California.

NOTE 4 - VALUATION OF MINERAL LANDS - DEFERRED INCOME TAXES

  The Mineral lands carried on the books at a value of $10,000
less depletion have a historical cost basis from June 19, 1901 of
$1,000,000.  Beginning in 1913, different valuations were placed on
these lands by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.  Under
instructions of the Commissioner, the values of the land were
written up on the books to a high of $4,500,000 on February 23,
1928.

  In 1934, because of depressed conditions, the mineral lands were
written down to $10,000 without any tax benefit.  In the event of
a sale of these lands the recognized gain for tax purposes will be
substantially reduced or eliminated.  Consequently a deferred tax
asset of approximately $340,000 has been offset by a
corresponding valuation allowance of approximately $340,000 due to
the unlikelihood of the sale of the property in the near future.

It is estimated that the current market value of the properties
meets or exceeds the $1,000,000 historical cost basis; however, due
to the length of time the Company has reported the land values at
the written down value of $10,000, a change to the cost method has
not been deemed appropriate for reporting purposes.
