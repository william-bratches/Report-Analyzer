American   Energy   &   Technology,   Inc.   ("Registrant")   was
incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 25,
1975.  The  Registrant's principal offices are located  at  #1500

The  Registrant  has  been inactive and  has  not  conducted  any
business  during the fiscal years ending April 30,  1987  through
April  30,  1996.  The current directors have taken the necessary
steps  to  bring  the Registrant current with all the  regulatory
filings.

On  March  18,  1994, the Registrant received  a  Certificate  of
Renewal from the State of Delaware.

The   Registrant  has  not  been  involved  in  any   bankruptcy,
receivership or similar proceedings.

subject  to re-negotiation of profits or termination of contracts
or subcontracts at the election of the Government.

AUDITORS' REPORT



To the Shareholders of
American Energy & Technology Inc.

We have reviewed the balance sheet of American Energy &
Technology Inc. as at April 30, 1996 and the statements of loss
and deficit and changes in financial position for the year then
ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.   Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.

In our opinion, these financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the company as at
April 30, 1996 and the results of its operations and the changes
in its financial position for the year then ended in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.
