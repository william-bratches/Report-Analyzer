Item 1.  Description of Business

(a)  Business Development.

     Eastco Industrial Safety Corp. ("Eastco"), the registrant, is 
a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of
New York, having been incorporated on May 15, 1958.

     The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Disposable
Safety Wear, Inc. ("Disposable"), Safety Wear Corp. ("Safety Wear"), Puerto
Rico Safety Equipment Corporation ("Puerto Rico Safety Equipment"), and
Puerto Rico Safety Corp. ("Puerto Rico Safety"), manufactures industrial
protective clothing products and distributes a wide range of industrial
safety products.  The Company's Manufacturing Operations sells its products
to distributors.  The Company's Distribution Operations sells products
to "end users," including manufacturing companies and service
businesses, public utilities, fisheries, pharmaceutical plants, the
transportation industry and companies engaged in hazardous
materials abatement.

(b) Business of Issuer.

Manufacturing Operations

     (1)  Manufactured products are sold under the "Charkate /
Worksafe", "Charkate", "Worksafe" and "COVER-UP" trade names. The
Company, through Disposable, Safety Wear and Puerto Rico Safety
Equipment manufactures disposable and reusable industrial
protective apparel.  Disposable protective products items include
coveralls, shirts, pants, hats, hoods, aprons, smocks, lab coats,
hazardous material handler suits, examination gowns, sleeves, shoe
covers and related items.  Disposable clothing is designed to
protect the user from, among other things, splash, dirt
contamination and against a wide range of hazardous substances. 
Disposable clothing is made primarily of a spun bonded polyolefin
produced solely by Dupont under the trade name Tyvek .  Reusable
industrial protective clothing consists of items for the protection
of various parts of the body which are designed to shield the user
from, among other things, splash, dirt, contamination, heat, fire,
cold and the outside environment.  Specific products manufactured
include coveralls, gloves, mitts, shirts,  thermal underwear,
sleeves, coats, pants, leggings, spats, bibs, safety vests and a
variety of other kinds of protective clothing and uniforms.  The
Company also manufactures welding blankets, curtains and screens. 

     Sales of manufactured disposable clothing and related
disposable products accounted for approximately 39% and 34% of the
Company's consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended June 30,
1995 and 1994, respectively.

     (2)  The Company's Manufacturing Operations and warehousing
are located in Puerto Rico, Alabama and California and are
primarily directed from New York.  The Company's products are sold
primarily in the United States and Puerto Rico. The Company sells<PAGE>
<PAGE>
its manufactured products through sales representatives.   In
addition, manufactured products are sold through the Company's
Distribution Operations in the Northeastern region of the United
States and Puerto Rico to "end users."  

     The Company utilizes catalogs to aid in its sales efforts,
although the Company does not engage in any mail order business. 
Sales are primarily to distributors who sell to "end users"
comprised of industrial, commercial and governmental accounts.  The
Company considers industrial accounts to be those businesses which
are primarily based upon manufacturing and production, while
commercial accounts are considered by the Company to be service
businesses.  The Company also believes that standards established
by OSHA have resulted in a need by others to purchase the Company's
products.  Sales are also promoted through trade shows, mailings
and advertising in trade magazines and directories.

(3)      The Company has made no public announcement of, or made public
information about, any new product in this segment which would require the
investment of a material amount of the Company's assets or which otherwise
is material.  

(4)      The market for industrial protective clothing and
industrial safety products is extremely competitive.  The Company
faces competition in all  of its product markets from large,
established companies that have greater financial, managerial,
sales and technical resources than the Company, and some of the
Company's product markets are dominated by such larger companies. 
Larger competitors also may be able to benefit from economies of
scale and introduce new products that compete with the Company's
products.  The Company's primary competitors in its Manufacturing
Operations are Kappler Inc. and Lakeland Industries, Inc., in
disposable clothing sales, and P.G.I., Incorporated, Red Kap, a
subsidiary of VF Industries Inc., Topps Mfg. Co. and Workrite
Uniform Co. in the sale of reusable clothing.  Primary competitors
in the manufacture of reusable gloves are Chicago Protective
Apparel, Inc. and Steel Grip, Inc.

(5)     The Company is not dependent upon any one company for a
source of supply of raw materials for its manufacturing operations
other than DuPont which supplies the Company with Tyvek  which is
used in various lines of its disposable products. Products
utilizing Tyvek  accounted for approximately 35% and 29% of
consolidated sales for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1995 and
June 30, 1994, respectively.  Management believes that its current
relationship with DuPont is satisfactory.

(6)     This segment of the Company is not dependent upon any single
customer or any few customers, the loss of any one or more of whom would
have an adverse effect on the business of the Company.  No one company or
customer accounts for more than 10% of this segment's sales.  

(7)      Puerto Rico Safety Equipment is engaged in manufacturing
in Puerto Rico and was granted an exemption for seventeen (17)
years under the Puerto Rico Industrial Tax Exemption Act of 1963
(the "Industrial Tax Act") with respect to Puerto Rico income taxes<PAGE>
<PAGE>
on the production of such items as safety clothing, protective
sleeves, coats, pants, hoods and jackets for the period commencing
January 1, 1970.  On July 1, 1989 Puerto Rico Safety Equipment was
granted an extension of its exemption and has a 90% exemption from
Puerto Rico income taxes for the ten-year period ending on June 30,
1999.  During this period, Puerto Rico Safety Equipment has a 75%
exemption from Puerto Rico municipal taxes on its real and personal
property utilized in its operations.

     Disposable has been granted a fifteen-year exemption under the
Industrial Tax Act with respect to Puerto Rico income taxes on its
operations covering the production of disposable clothing and with
respect to the property used in its operations for the period
commencing June 4, 1977, subject to the terms of the grant.  The
Company was advised on September 14, 1995, that this exemption has
been extended until June 30, 2006 on the basis of a 90% exemption
on Puerto Rico income taxes and a 60% exemption on municipal taxes
on its real and personal property.  A copy of the extension has not
yet been received.

     Puerto Rico Safety Equipment and Disposable have elected to
apply Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, effective July 1,
1979.  The provisions of Section 936 are effective until revoked by
the Company.  If the conditions of Section 936(a)(2) are satisfied,
the Section 936 credit equals the portion of the United States
income tax that is attributable to taxable income from sources
outside the United States derived from the active conduct of a
trade or business within a United States possession, or the sale or
exchange of substantially all of the qualified possession source
investment income.  Dividends payable by each subsidiary to the
Company from operations are entitled to a 100% dividends received
deduction but are subject to a 10% withholding tax in Puerto Rico. 
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the "Omnibus Act") 
imposes new limitations on computing the Possession Tax Credit under 
Section 936 for tax years beginning after 1993.  There are two methods for
determining the credit under the new law.  Under the first method, the
amount of the credit may be determined by using the so-called economic
activity limit.  This attempts to limit the credit by applying various
percentages to possession-based compensation, depreciation and taxes paid 
or accrued.  Alternatively, the Company may make an irrevocable
election when it files its June 30, 1995 federal income tax return
to have present rules apply, but to phase out the credit to 60% of
the 1994 level, and further phase down by 5% per year to 40% in
1998 and years thereafter.  Since the credit is a function of
future earnings, if any, the effect of such limitations cannot be
determined at the present time.  In addition, the Omnibus Act
makes the 100% dividends received deduction subject to the Alternative
Minimum Tax Calculation.  No dividends have been declared on the aggregate
undistributed earnings of Puerto Rico Safety Equipment and Disposable (which
through June 30, 1995, aggregates approximately $2,305,000) and none are
intended to be declared because it is management's intention to reinvest the
earnings, if any, from such subsidiaries indefinitely.  The Company
believes that based upon current operations, the Omnibus Act
will not have a material effect on the Company for the foreseeable
future.<PAGE>
<PAGE>
     As Puerto Rico tax exemptions are reduced or expire the
Company may be required to pay taxes on income earned in Puerto
Rico.  The Company is unable to predict the amount of such impact
after such exemptions are reduced or expire.   

(8) and (9)    The Company does not believe that there is a need
for governmental approval for it to  sell its principal products in
this segment.  Various of the Company's products are subject to
OSHA, NIOSHA, NFPA and other governmental standards.

     
(10)      The Company, during the last two fiscal years, has not
spent any material amount on research and development relating to
the development of new products, services or techniques or the
improvement of existing products, services or techniques.

(11)     Compliance with Federal, State and local environmental
laws is expected to have no material effect upon capital expenditures,
earnings and the competitive position of the Company.  

     The Company's manufacturing facilities are subject to
regulation and inspection standards established by OSHA.  Such
facilities have not yet been inspected for compliance with OSHA. 
Although the Company believes it is in material compliance with
required standards, there can be no assurance that any inspection
will not reveal that the Company has failed to comply with OSHA and
that, as a result, the Company may be required to expend sums,
which can be costly, to assure compliance with OSHA regulations.

(12)    The total number of employees employed by the registrant as
of June 30, 1995 was approximately 200 for both segments.

Distribution Operations

(1)  The Company, primarily through Eastco, distributes industrial
safety products to "end-users" made by the Charkate / Worksafe
division as well as by non-affiliated companies.  These products
include hard hats, protective glasses, ear muffs, ear plugs,
respirators, goggles, face shields, rainwear, protective footwear,
first-aid kits, monitoring devices, signs and related products. 
These products are sold to manufacturing companies and service
businesses, including public utilities, fisheries, hospitals,
pharmaceutical plants, the transportation industry and companies
engaged in hazardous materials abatement.

     Use of products sold by the Company has in a large part
resulted from the adoption of OSHA standards and the awareness of
industry and the general public for the need to remove asbestos,
lead and other hazardous materials contained in industrial
facilities, schools and buildings.  A number of these products are
marketed by the Company to purchasers, who among other things,
utilize some of these products for protection against hazardous
materials.

     The Company supplies a variety of items which may be used
during the removal and/or encapsulation of hazardous materials in<PAGE>
<PAGE>
office buildings, chemical plants, refineries, electric generating
plants and schools.  Abatement products sold by the Company include
in the largest part, items made by other companies, such as negative air
machines, respirators, air filtration equipment, vacuums, polybags and
sheetings, decontamination showers, signs, tools, pumps, sprayers and
related equipment.  The Company does not engage in the removal or
encapsulation of hazardous materials.  Sales of these products accounted for
approximately 22% and 23% of the Company's consolidated revenues for the
fiscal years ended June 30, 1995 and June 30, 1994, respectively.  The
foregoing percentages do not include products used in the abatement field
which are manufactured by the Company.

(2)  The Company's Distribution Operations are primarily directed
from the Company's offices in New York.  The Company also has
facilities for warehousing and distribution of its non-manufactured
products in Puerto Rico, Connecticut and Florida.  The Company
sells a variety of safety products from independent manufacturers,
including, but not limited to 3M, Racal Health and Safety, Inc. and
Willson Safety Products, a division of WGM Safety Corporation. 
Items distributed are sold primarily in the Northeastern region of
the United States.

     The Company employs 10 full-time salesmen in its Distribution
Operations who sell products distributed by the Company, and on a
more limited basis, products manufactured by the Company.  The
Company uses catalogs and telemarketing to aid in its sales
efforts.  The Company does not engage in any mail order business
nor sell on a retail basis.  Sales are primarily to industrial,
commercial and governmental accounts which are "end users".

(3)      The Company has made no public announcement of, or made
public information about, any new product in this segment which
would require the investment of a material amount of the Company's
assets or which otherwise is material.  

(4)  The market for industrial protective clothing and industrial
safety products is extremely competitive.  The Company faces
competition in all  of its product markets from large, established
companies that have greater financial, managerial, sales and
technical resources than the Company, and some of the Company's
products markets are dominated by such larger companies. Larger
competitors also may be able to benefit from economies of scale and
introduce new products that compete with the Company's products.
The Company's major competitors in its Distribution Operations are
Balco Industries, Inc. and Freemont Safety Corp. in industrial
sales, and Insulation Distributions Company, Industrial Productions
Company and Aramsco Company in abatement sales.

(5)  The Company serves as a distributor for various firms but is
not dependent upon any one company for which it acts as a
distributor.

(6)     This segment of the Company is not dependent upon any
single customer or any few customers, the loss of any one or more
of whom would have an adverse effect on the business of the<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Company.  No one company or customer accounts for more than 10% of
this segment's sales.

(7)  Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions are
not material to this segment.
 
(8) and (9)    The Company does not believe that there is a need
for governmental approval for it to  sell its principal products in
this segment.  Various of the Company's products are subject to
OSHA, NIOSHA, NFPA and other governmental standards.

(10)    The Company, during the last two fiscal years, has not
spent any material amount on research and development relating to
the development of new products, services or techniques, or the
improvement of existing products, services or techniques.

(11) Compliance with Federal, State and local environmental laws is
expected to have no material effect upon capital expenditures,
zonings and the competitive position of the Company.

(12) See (12) above under the Company's Manufacturing Operations.

Item 2.  Description of Property

     The following properties are material to the business of the
Company:

     The executive offices of the Company are located at 130 West
10th Street, Huntington Station, New York and are owned by the
Company (the "Huntington Property").  The Huntington Property is
also used for warehousing and distributing and contains
approximately 25,000 square feet of warehouse space and 5,000
square feet of office space.  At June 30, 1995, the premises were
subject to a first real estate mortgage due to 130 West 10th Street
Associates, LLC  ("Associates"). in the amount of $538,544.  The
wives of Messrs. Alan Densen and Anthony Towell, executive officers
and directors of the Company and Herbert Schneiderman, a director,
are members of Associates.

     The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Disposable, leases a
building consisting of approximately 45,000 square feet in Aguadilla, Puerto
Rico from the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company which is used for
manufacturing and warehousing.  A lease was entered into for these premises
on February 21, 1995, effective for the ten year period commencing September
1, 1993.  Rent for the two year period ending August 31, 1996 is at the
monthly rate of $7,079, which escalates to $13,040.54 in the final year of
the lease.

     The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Safety Wear, occupies
approximately 30,000 square feet in Decatur, Alabama.  The premises
are utilized for the cutting and warehousing of coveralls and the<PAGE>
<PAGE>
manufacturing of disposable products.  The Company pays $6,450 rent
per month. The premises are leased on a month-to-month basis. 
Should these facilities not be available to the Company, the
Company believes that alternative sites are available at a
comparative cost.

Item 3.   Legal Proceedings

     The Company, in the past, used asbestos in the manufacture of
its products.  Such use was terminated by the Company in the mid-
1980's.  It has been alleged that asbestos is a cause of cancer,
asbestosis, mesothelioma, and other related diseases, the symptoms
of which may not appear for twenty or more years.  Since the early
1980's, numerous lawsuits have been instituted against the Company
by persons who have been exposed to asbestos and asbestos products. 
Such legal proceedings, for the most part, are covered by the
Company's insurance policies.  

     During fiscal 1994, the Company reached a settlement
pertaining to all pending and future cases against Eastco in the
State of  New York brought by one firm of plaintiffs' attorneys,
which firm has been primarily responsible for bringing asbestos
actions against the Company in the State of New York.  The
settlement does not apply to Puerto Rico Safety Equipment and is
only applicable to cases brought by the same law firm against the
Company in the state of New York.  The Company is to be dismissed
without any payment in cases not involving any exposure to a power
generating station in the State of New York ("Powerhouse").  Where
there is Powerhouse exposure, a payment of $100 is to be made for
each alleged nonmalignant case and $300 for each malignant case. 
Where plaintiffs consist of two spouses, such is deemed one case. 
Payment is to await appropriate documentation of exposure, releases
from the plaintiffs and the agreement of each plaintiff whose case
is settled.  A copy of the letters between counsel for the Company
and counsel for plaintiffs' attorneys setting forth this settlement
is annexed hereto as Exhibit 28.3 and referred to as Exhibit 28.7.

     As of June 30, 1995, the Company estimates that it is a party
to approximately 250 cases with respect to exposure to asbestos
involving approximately 480 plaintiffs, of which no cases  pertain
to Puerto Rico Safety Equipment.  Reference is made to Exhibit 28.4
for a schedule of the pending actions against the Company, as of
June 30, 1995, that have not been settled or dismissed. 

     All of the actions against the Company to date have been
brought by non-employees of the Company and are based upon personal
injury claims.  The pending actions are in the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York; Superior Court of New
Jersey, Middlesex County, Law Division; Court of Common Pleas of
Luzerne County, Trial Division of Pennsylvania; and the San
Francisco County Superior Court of California.  The number of
first-party plaintiffs include, in various instances, spouses of

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
said plaintiffs.  The actions, with the exception of one pending
action, involve a multitude of defendants.  The complaints allege
exposure to asbestos and asbestos products over various periods of
time.  Each seeks varying amounts of damages, usually unlimited, or
for each plaintiff as high as $10,000,000 for compensatory damages
and $20,000,000 for punitive damages.  The Company may become a
party to additional asbestos actions in the future.  

     From 1981 through June 30, 1995, the Company estimates that
approximately 830 actions on behalf of approximately 6,400 first-
party plaintiffs have been instituted against it concerning
asbestos-related claims and that approximately 570 actions and the
claims of approximately 5,920 plaintiffs have been terminated
against the Company.  During fiscal 1995, the Company estimates
approximately 120 actions on behalf of approximately 970 first
party plaintiffs were instituted against it and approximately 40
actions on behalf of approximately 830 plaintiffs actions were
settled or discontinued against it.  The Company estimates that as
of June 30, 1995, with the exception of defense costs, a total of
approximately $1,300,000 has been paid, or agreed to be paid, in
settlements to date with regard to the terminated actions
(inclusive of actions against Puerto Rico Safety Equipment) of
which all but approximately $25,000 has been paid by the Company's
insurance carriers. The Company has been notified that for actions 
terminated subsequent to June 30, 1995, its share of the settlements
made will be approximately $15,000. The foregoing is based upon 
information available to the Company to date and assumes certain 
settlements in the process of being made and payments to be made 
thereunder by insurance companies awaiting documentation from plaintiffs. 
Through June 30, 1995, the Company has paid less than $40,000 for
legal and defense costs to counsel appointed by the insurance
carriers to defend it.  Past results of settlements and defense
costs are not necessarily indicative of future settlements and
defense costs, which the Company is unable to predict.

     For the period April 1, 1968 to April 1, 1969 and March 11,
1971 to November 27, 1985, the Company believes that it has various
policies of primary insurance in different amounts which would
protect it against liability for asbestos-made, product-related
personal injuries.  The policies range in amounts from $50,000 to
$1,000,000.  The Company also believes that since August 10, 1972
to on or about August 11, 1986 it has had various policies for
excess coverage applicable to asbestos claims.  These policies
range in amounts from $500,000 to $10,000,000 for excess coverage. 
There are gaps of approximately six weeks in the primary coverage
between March 11, 1971 to November 27, 1985 and approximately
thirty-six months in the excess coverage between August 10, 1972
and August 11, 1986.  Reference is made to Exhibits 28.5 and 28.6
for a schedule of the foregoing insurance policies.  The policies
of insurance set forth on Exhibits 28.5 and 28.6 are not applicable
to all of the subsidiaries of the Company, which have varying
coverage, and such subsidiaries may also be without coverage for
various times of their doing business.  Not all of these policies
are in the possession of the Company.  <PAGE>
<PAGE>
     Effective June 26, 1990, an agreement between the Company and its
primary insurance carriers dated March 26, 1990 became effective.  The
Company entered into this agreement in an effort to resolve uncertainties as
to its insurance coverage which will cover asbestos claims against the
parent Company where any exposure to asbestos is alleged during the period
1971 to 1985, inclusive.  Pursuant to this agreement, the Company is
obligated to share in the payment of asbestos-related claims against Eastco. 
Pursuant to the agreement, the Company is obligated to pay 12% of all
attorneys' fees incurred on its behalf and 17% of indemnity costs (which
include judgment and settlement amounts).  The balance of these costs are to
be paid by the insurance carriers which are party to the agreement.  The
agreement is subject to policy limitations of each insurance policy.  The
agreement may be terminated at any time upon ninety (90) days' notice by any
of the parties provided that termination may not be effective as to any
asbestos action that has already been placed on the trial calendar, unless
it has a scheduled trial date more than twelve (12) months from the date the
notice of termination is given.  The Company has been advised that no
pending cases are on the trial calendar.  A copy of the defense and
indemnity agreement dated March 26, 1990 is set forth in schedule 28.4. 

     Effective during May, 1991 the Company entered into a
Settlement Agreement and Release with Mount Vernon Fire Insurance
Company.  Pursuant to this Agreement, which is Exhibit 28.1  which
is incorporated  by reference to the Company's Form 10-K for the
year ended June 30, 1993, the Company discontinued its action
against Mount Vernon, which agreed that, subject to the terms of
the Agreement, Mount Vernon would reimburse the Company (where
applicable) for 6.25% of attorneys' fees (52.08% of the Company's
12% share referred to in the agreement in the previous paragraph)
and 6.25% of indemnification costs (36.76% of the Company's 17%
share referred to in the agreement in the previous paragraph).  The
Agreement is not applicable to any asbestos actions against the
Company where no exposure is alleged to products manufactured or
distributed by Eastco between April 1, 1968 and April 1, 1969.  The
Agreement may be terminated at any time upon 90 days' notice, but
such notice is not applicable to asbestos actions placed on a trial
calendar, unless such has a trial date more than twelve months from
the date the notice of termination is given.  The agreement
provides that the limit available under the policy is $100,000 plus
attorneys' fees while the agreement is in effect and is applicable
only to the parent company.  Approximately $14,000 has been
reimbursed by Mount Vernon Fire Insurance Company as of June 30,
1995 for indemnification.

     The Company is unable to ascertain the total extent of
insurance applicable to asbestos claims against it or the extent to
which its insurance carriers will provide coverage.  The two
agreements  referred to above between the Company and the insurance
carriers may not be applicable to Puerto Rico Safety Equipment
Corporation , which is covered by other insurance.  To date, the
claims settled by Puerto Rico Safety Equipment Corporation have
been paid in full by insurance.  A schedule of insurance believed
to be applicable to Puerto Rico Safety Equipment Corporation is
Exhibit 28.2 which is incorporated by reference to the Company's

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 1992.  No agreement has been
reached with the insurance companies confirming all of these
policies, which range from $100,000 to $500,000 for primary
coverage and $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 for excess coverage.  The
policies for Puerto Rico Safety Equipment Corporation cover the
period March 11, 1971 to July 23, 1986 with various gaps as
described on the exhibit.  

     An action entitled Michael F. Cilone and Marie Cilone v.
Willson Safety Products, Inc., Standard Coating Corporation,
National Paint Co., Inc., E.I. Dupont De Nemours & Co Inc., Orb
Industries, Inc., PPG Industries Inc., Olde England Paint & Varnish
Corp., Oatey Co., d/b/a Bond Tight Products, Eastco Industrial
Safety Corp. was instituted on September 19, 1988 in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of Kings.  The Company has
referred this matter to its insurance carriers applicable to the
period 1984 to 1986 and who have provided primary insurance on an
annual basis of $1,000,000 per year in addition to applicable
excess carriers. The complaint alleges four causes of action,
including one for punitive damages on behalf of Michael F. Cilone,
against the Company in the amount of $5,000,000 each and one cause
of action for $500,000 on behalf of Marie Cilone.  The complaint
alleges that the Company sold respirators made by Willson Safety
Products and other safety equipment to Michael F. Cilone's
employer, the New York City Transit Authority, between 1984 and
1986 and that he sustained injuries as a result of chemicals and
various materials made by the other defendants.  The Company has
been advised by counsel, designated by its insurance carriers to
defend it, that the insurance in effect should be ample with
respect to any settlement contribution and / or liability
allocation by a jury.  This is based upon the present status of the
case and the fact that depositions have not yet all been completed. 

     The Company's insurance may not provide coverage for punitive
damages where such damages are sought against it in pending
litigation.  Punitive damages are allowable in addition to
compensatory damages and are awarded as a punishment to the
defendant for the wrong in the particular case as well as for the
protection of the public against similar acts, to deter the
defendant from a repetition of the wrongful act and to serve as a
warning to others.  Usually a wrong, aggravated by an evil or
wrongful motive or a willful and intentional misdoing or a reckless
indifference equivalent thereto, is required for a court to award
punitive damages.  The Company is unable to specify whether its
actions would give rise to punitive damages.  It believes that its
actions should not give rise to punitive damages.  There, however,
can be no assurance that this will be the case.

Item 6.   Management's Discussion and Analysis

(a)  Not applicable.

(b)  Liquidity and Capital Resources

     The Company had working capital as of June 30, 1995 of
$1,065,000 as compared to working capital of $1,042,000 as of June
30, 1994.  A substantial portion of the Company's working capital
consists of inventory, which was $4,364,000 and $3,166,000 as of
June 30, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The Company is required to
maintain substantial inventories of its numerous products to meet
the immediate requirements of its customers who need products on
short notice and who do not maintain an inventory of such products.

     The Company has a line of credit agreement with Congress which
expires October 1, 1996, whereby the Company may borrow up to
$5,750,000, with interest payable monthly at 2 1/2% above the prime
rate, plus an unused line fee of 1/4% per year.  Borrowings under
this agreement are limited to 50% of the eligible inventory up to
a maximum of $2,875,000 and 80% of eligible accounts receivable. 
The amounts outstanding at June 30, 1995, and June 30, 1994 were
$4,829,000 and  $3,184,000, respectively.  The Company had $40,000
available for borrowing at June 30, 1995.  The loan is subject to
certain working capital and net worth requirements and is
collateralized by all of the assets of the Company not previously
pledged under other loan agreements.  The loan agreement prohibits
the payment of cash dividends by the Company. 

     In September 1993, the Company received an overadvance of
$500,000 from Congress.  In connection therewith, Messrs. A.
Densen, L. Densen and A. Towell obtained the Junior Participation
from Congress by advancing $250,000 of their funds to Congress. 
$250,000 of this overadvance has been repaid to Congress.  The
balance of $250,000 will be repaid by Congress, at its option, to
Messrs. A. Densen, L. Densen and A. Towell, subject to the
availability of funds. 

     During April and May 1994, the Company sold in a public
offering, 2,300,000 units at $2.00 per unit.  Each unit consisted
of one share of Common Stock and one Class A Warrant.  Each Class
A Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock
at a reduced exercise price of $1.30 a share until April 12, 1999. 
The net proceeds from the 1994 public offering were $3,446,000 and
have enabled the Company to return to profitability.  

     The Company believes that its current working capital
position, line of credit and operations will be sufficient to
satisfy its cash needs through June 30, 1996.

     The Company has no material commitments for capital
expenditures.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
     At the present time, the Company, together with a variety of
defendants, is a party to various asbestos-related lawsuits
involving a number of plaintiffs alleging damages from exposure to
asbestos products sold by the Company.  The Company may become a
party to additional asbestos-related actions in the future.  The
Company is also party to a non-asbestos product liability action. 
While as indicated in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, legal and
settlement costs to the Company have not been material to date, the
Company cannot, at this time, determine the outcome of these
uncertainties which may have an  adverse effect upon the liquidity
of the Company in the future.

     Inflation

     The impact of inflation on the Company's operations has not
been significant to date.  There can be no assurance that a high
rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on
the Company's operations.     

Results of Operations

     Fiscal Year 1995 Compared to Fiscal Year 1994

     The Company's net income for fiscal 1995 was $78,000 compared
to a net loss of $2,711,000 for fiscal 1994. Fiscal 1995 was the
first profitable year for the Company since fiscal 1989.

     Consolidated net sales during fiscal 1995 increased by 15.8%
to $24,025,000 from $20,746,000 during fiscal 1994.  In fiscal
1995, Distribution Operations revenues increased 6.7% to $9,233,000
from $8,654,000 and Manufacturing Operations revenues increased
22.3% to $14,792,000 from $12,092,000.  The Company believes that
the increase in sales was due to improved industry conditions in
both segments.  In addition, the net proceeds from the 1994 public
offering allowed the Company to establish increased credit lines
with its vendors.

     The Company's gross profit margin increased to 19.9% in fiscal
1995 as compared to 16.3% in fiscal 1994.  The Company believes
that this increase was primarily due to continued manufacturing
efficiencies and targeting sales that produce higher gross profits.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 1995
decreased by 11.9% to $4,149,000 or 17.3% of sales, from $4,709,000
or 22.7% of sales in fiscal 1994.  The decrease was principally due
to a reduction in bad debt expenses of $177,000, a reduction in
consulting fees and salaries to former officers of $245,000, as
well as the advertising incentives and purchase discounts of
$97,000.

     Interest expense was $584,000 for fiscal 1995 as compared to
$1,392,000 in the prior year.  This decrease was principally due to

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

debt financing charges of $812,000 on convertible debt and bridge-loan 
financing in fiscal 1994 which did not reoccur in fiscal 1995.

     The increase in the number of shares used to calculate per
share amounts in 1995 results from the number of shares sold in the
1994 public offering.  Outstanding options and warrants did not
materially dilute earnings per share in 1995, but could do so in
the future if there is a significant increase in the spread between
their exercise price and the quoted market price of the Company's
Common Stock.

     Fiscal Year 1994 Compared to Fiscal Year 1993

     The Company's net loss for fiscal 1994 was $2,711,000 compared
to a net loss of $858,000 in fiscal 1993.

     Consolidated net sales during fiscal 1994 decreased by 22.3%
to $20,746,000 from $26,668,000 during fiscal 1993.  In fiscal
1994, Distribution Operations revenues decreased 22.7% to
$8,654,000 from $11,201,000 and Manufacturing Operations revenues
decreased 21.9% to $12,092,000 from $15,482,000.  The Company
believes that the reduction in sales was caused by its continued
lack of working capital and weak industry conditions as well as, to
a lesser degree, management's new strategy whereby the Company
focused its manufacturing efforts on products generating higher
margins as opposed to volume.  The lack of adequate working capital
caused a shortage in materials in the manufacturing segment and a
lack of available inventory in the distribution segment.  Although
the Company received an availability of an overline credit of
$500,000 from its principal lender in September 1993 and received
during the third quarter $990,000 from bridge loans, these only
partially relieved the Company's working capital deficiency.  In
April of 1994, the Company received $3,446,000 from its public
stock offering which significantly alleviated its working capital
constraints, but had little impact on the results of its operations
since the money was received late in the Company's fiscal year.

     The Company's gross profit margin increased to 16.3% in fiscal
1994 as compared to 15.8% in fiscal 1993.  The Company believes
that this increase is primarily the result of manufacturing
efficiencies and targeting sales that would result in higher gross
profits.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 1994,
increased by 6.7% to $4,709,000 or 22.7% of sales, from $4,393,000
or 16.5% of sales, in fiscal 1993.  This was principally due to an
increase in consulting fees and salaries to former officers of
$245,000, the cancellation and waiver in 1994 and 1993,
respectively, of the deferred compensation agreement with the
Company's President resulting in a $65,000 credit to operations as
compared to a $196,000 credit in the prior year and by a reduction
in bad debt expense of $29,000, which only partially offset the
above increases.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

     Interest expense was $1,392,000 for fiscal 1994 as compared to
$719,000 in the prior year.  The increase was principally due to
debt financing costs of $812,000 on convertible  debt and bridge
loan financing, offset by a reduction of interest charged on short-
term borrowings.

Employment Agreements

As of July 1, 1995, Alan E. Densen entered into a new employment agreement
replacing an earlier employment agreement which commenced as of the effective 
date of the Company's 1994 public offering.  A copy of the new agreement is 
annexed hereto as Exhibit 10.8.  The employment agreement with Alan E. 
Densen provides for him to serve as the Company's President for a term of 
five years.  At the end of each fiscal year during the term of the 
agreement, the agreement is automatically extended for one 
additional year to be added at the end of the then current term
of the agreement, unless the Board of Directors determines to the contrary. 
The base annual salary is $125,000 for fiscal 1996 which shall be increased at
the beginning of each fiscal year commencing July 1, 1996, at the discretion of
the Board of Directors.  Each increase is not to be less than 10% of the
minimum compensation paid to the employee in the prior fiscal year.  Mr. Densen
is also eligible to receive an annual bonus equal to 3 1/3% of the Company's
earnings before interest and taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996 and
each fiscal year thereafter during the term of the agreement.  The bonus is to
be paid within 30 days of the completion of the Company's audited financial
statement for each fiscal year and is to be paid in cash or registered shares
of common stock of the Company.  In addition, Mr. Densen is entitled to 
receive reimbursement of ordinary and necessary business expenses, a 
monthly automobile allowance of $700 and disability, medical, 
hospitalization, and life insurance.

<PAGE>

The employment agreement entered into by Alan E. Densen includes provisions
that provide for his right to terminate the agreement and thereby receive
additional compensation, as provided below, in the event that he is not elected
or retained as President and a director of the Company; the Company acts 
to materially reduce his duties and responsibilities under the agreement; the
Company changes the geographic location of his duties to a location from the
New York metropolitan area; his base compensation is reduced by 10% or more;
any successor to the Company fails to assume the agreement; any other material
breach of the agreement which is not cured by the Company within 30 days; and
a "Change of Control" by which a person, other than a person who is an officer
and/or director of the Company as of the effective date of the agreements, or
a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the combined voting power of 
the then outstanding securities of the Company.

In the event that Alan E. Densen terminates his position because of any of the
aforesaid reasons other than a "Change of Control", or if the Company
terminates his employment in any way that is a breach of the agreement by the
employer, Mr. Densen shall be entitled to receive, in addition to his salary
continuation, as a bonus, a cash payment equal to his total base salary plus
projected expenses and bonuses for the remainder of the term thereof, payable
within 30 days of termination and all stock options, warrants and other stock 
appreciation rights granted by the Company to him shall become immediately 
exercisable at an exercise price of $0.10 per share.  In the event that he 
owns or is entitled to receive any unregistered securities of the Company, 
than the Company shall register such securities within 120 days of the 
his termination.

In the event that there is a "Change of Control", he shall be paid within 30 
days thereof a one-time bonus equal to his total minimum base salary for 
the next three years and he shall be immediately reimbursed for all amounts 
not yet received for his participation in a total of $250,000 of junior 
participation with Congress in loans to the Company made during September 
1993, without regard to whether such amount is currently due pursuant to 
the terms thereof.

Compensation to Directors

No compensation is paid to directors for their serving solely as a director, 
other than outside directors who are compensated at the rate of $500 for 
each board of directors meeting which they attend in person.

exercisable at $1.30 per share.

(2)  Includes 9,000 Class A Warrants; an incentive stock option to acquire

incentive stock option to acquire 20,000 shares of Common Stock granted      
January 20, 1995 which expires January 19, 2005 and is exercisable at

until January 19, 2005 at an exercise price of $1.0625, the closing market
price of the Common Stock on the date of grant.  These options were granted in
consideration of previous sacrifices including reduction in salaries,
cancellation of options and other surrendered benefits by such executive
officers as well as the turnaround performance achieved by the Company. The
turnaround achieved by the Company in its performance can be directly related
to the efforts of Messrs. A. Densen, A. Towell and L. Densen.  These options
can not be exercised during the first five years unless (a) the audited pre-tax 
profits for fiscal 1995 are greater than $50,000, then options to acquire
200,000 shares of Common Stock may be exercised and (b) the audited      
pre-tax profits for fiscal 1996 are greater than $250,000, then options to    
 
purchase the remaining 200,000 shares of Common Stock may be exercised.
It was determined in September 1995 that these options can now be exercised for
200,000 shares of Common Stock and such 200,000 shares are included in the
above table for each individual.<PAGE>

Item 12.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

During September, 1993 the Company's lender, Congress, agreed to provide an
overadvance to the Company of $500,000.  In connection therewith, Messrs. A.
Densen, L. Densen and A. Towell obtained a junior participation interest from
Congress by advancing $250,000 of their funds to Congress. $250,000 of this
overadvance was repaid to Congress during fiscal 1994.  The balance of $250,000
will be repaid by Congress, at its option, to Messrs. A. Densen, L. Densen and 
A. Towell, subject to the availability of funds.

Associates holds a first mortgage on the Company's executive offices and 
warehouse facility in the principal amount of $538,544 as of June 30, 1995.  
The wives of Alan E. Densen and Anthony P. Towell, executive officers and 
directors of the Company, and Herbert Schneiderman, a director of the Company 
are members of Associates.  During the year ended June 30, 1995, the Company 
paid Associates $121,108 in principal and interest on the mortgage.

See note (4) in Item 11(a) with reference to non-qualified options granted to
Messrs. A. Densen, L. Densen and A. Towell. 

On January 31, 1995, the Company's board of directors reduced the exercise
price of the 2.3 million outstanding Class A Warrants issued in connection with
the 1994 Public Offering to $1.30 per share.  At the same time, the board of 
directors also reduced the exercise price to $1.30 per share with regard to the
108,333 warrants ("Associate Warrants") issued to a group of investors, 
including the spouses of Alan Densen (16,667 Associate Warrants owned by her) 
and Anthony P. Towell (16,667 Associate Warrants owned by her), and to Herbert 
Schneiderman (8,333 Associate Warrants owned by him), in connection with a 
reduction of indebtedness regarding the Company's premises, 400,000 warrants 
purchased by Anthony P. Towell, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, from 
Scorpio Partners, L.P. ("Scorpio") ("Towell Warrants"), 40,782 Royce warrants 
issued in connection with a 1991 public offering and 8,333 warrants in 
connection with a 1991 bridge loan. All these warrants have also been extended 
to April 11, 1999.  These warrants were all adjusted as indicated so as to
treat them on an equal basis and to provide incentives for them to be
exercised.

The Company had employment agreements with Messrs. A. Densen, A. Towell and L.
Densen, which commenced as of the effective date of the Company's 1994 public
offering in April, 1994.  As of July 1, 1995, these executive officers entered 
into new agreements.  Copies of the new agreements are annexed hereto as 
Exhibits 10.8, 10.9 and 10.10, respectively.  See Item 10, Executive 
Compensation - Employment Agreements with regards to provisions contained in 
the employment agreement of Alan E. Densen, the Company's President and CEO.  
Similar provisions are contained in each of the employment agreements with 
Anthony P. Towell and Lawrence Densen.  See also note 8 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

On July 10, 1995 the Company terminated its relationship with Lew Lieberbaum 
& Co., Inc. ("Lew Lieberbaum"), the Company's underwriter in its 1994 public 
offering.  Pursuant to an agreement dated July 10, 1995 (the "Underwriting 
Agreement"), the Company canceled all of Lew Lieberbaum's rights under the 
Underwriting Agreement, including, but not limited to, the right of first 
refusal to act on behalf of the 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Company in future transactions, the cancellation of all Underwriter's 
Warrants held by Lew Lieberbaum or its affiliates, their right to 
representation on the Company's board of directors and the termination 
of any obligation by holders of securities subject to a "lock-up" to 
obtain the permission of Lew Lieberbaum prior to sale or other disposition 
of said securities.  At the same time, Leonard A. Neuhaus and
Sheldon Lieberbaum, who are affiliated with Lew Lieberbaum, resigned as 
directors of the Company.  In exchange, the Company issued 100,000 shares of 
common stock to Lew Lieberbaum and has agreed to register these shares with 
the Securities & Exchange Commission by October 31, 1995 or to issue an 
additional 50,000 shares and register all of the shares if such registration 
statement is not filed by said date.

On April 18, 1995, the Company entered into an agreement with Donald & Co.
Securities Inc. ("Donald") to act as its investment adviser for a term of three
years at a retainer of $3,000 per month.  The agreement may be terminated for 
cause at any time and after eighteen (18) months by either party upon
forty-five days notice.  Donald was also granted a five year warrant to
purchase 125,000 shares exercisable at $1.25 per share, the closing market
price on the date of grant.  James Favia, a director of the Company, serves as
a consultant to Donald.

Board of Directors and Shareholders
Eastco Industrial Safety Corp.
Huntington, New York


   
   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of EASTCO
INDUSTRIAL SAFETY CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES as at June 30, 1995 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 1995.  These 
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on 
our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

   In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Eastco 
Industrial Safety Corp. and Subsidiaries as at June 30, 1995 and the results 
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the
period ended June 30, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles.

   As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company is a defendant in various lawsuits, together with a multitude of other
defendants, in actions alleging exposure by plaintiffs to asbestos and products
containing asbestos sold by the Company over unspecified periods of time.  The
Company is also a defendant in a non-asbestos related product liability 
lawsuit. While the Company has entered into an agreement with its primary 
insurance companies which limits its liability with respect to certain asbestos 
litigation, the ultimate outcome or range of liability, if any, resulting from 
the various lawsuits cannot presently be determined.  Accordingly, no provision 
for any liability that may result has been made in the accompanying 
consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

         The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
         Eastco Industrial Safety Corp. and its subsidiaries, all of which
         are wholly-owned.  All significant intercompany balances and
         transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

         Cash:

         Cash includes certificates of deposit of approximately $500,000 in
         1995 and $475,000 in 1994 which are considered cash equivalents on
         the statement of cash flows.  At June 30, 1995, a $300,000
         certificate has been pledged as collateral for a bank loan to the
         extent of such loan (see Note 5).

         Inventories:

         Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined on a
         first-in, first-out basis) or market, which represents estimated
         net realizable value.

         Depreciation and Amortization:

         Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line
         basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. 
         Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over
         the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining term
         of the lease.

         Income Taxes:

         In 1987, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
         Financial Accounting Standards No. 96.  Financial Accounting
         Standards Statement No. 109 (FASB 109), which superseded FASB 96,
         was adopted for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.  However,
         because of the similarity of these two statements as they affect
         the Company, the adoption of FASB 109 did not have a material
         effect on the consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued):

         Per Share Amounts:

         Earnings and loss per share amounts have been computed utilizing
         the weighted average number of common shares outstanding each
         year.  Such computations do not include common stock equivalents
         (Notes 6 and 7) because their inclusion would not be material for
         1995 and they were anti-dilutive for 1994.


NOTE 2 - Inventories:

         Inventories consist of the following at June 30, 1995:

NOTE 4 - Income Taxes:
                                       
  Effective July 1, 1993, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
  109 (SFAS 109) became effective for the Company.  The adoption of SFAS 109
  had no effect on the financial statements as at June 30, 1994 and for the
  year then ended.  While SFAS 109 requires the recognition of a deferred
  tax asset for the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards, it also
  requires the recognition of a valuation allowance when it is more likely
  than not that such benefit will not be realized.  As a result of the
  Company's past history of losses, it has recorded a valuation allowance
  of $2,237,000, which equals the net deferred tax asset account at June 30,
  1995.

  Deferred income taxes at June 30, 1995 relate to the following temporary
  differences and carryforwards:

          Deferred tax assets:
            Net operating loss carryforwards                $2,056,000
            Allowance for doubtful accounts and credits        124,000

NOTE 4 - Income Taxes (Continued):
       
   Two wholly-owned Puerto Rico based subsidiaries have been granted
   exemptions from paying Puerto Rico income taxes under provisions of the
   Puerto Rico Industrial Tax Exemption Act of 1963, provided such sub-
   sidiaries continue to meet the terms and conditions of their grants.     
   One subsidiary's exemption expires June 30, 1999. The subsidiary has 
   received a 90% exemption from Puerto Rico income taxes and a 75%        
   exemption from Puerto Rico municipal and property taxes.  The second 
   subsidiary has received a 90% exemption from Puerto Rico income and        
   property taxes and a 60% exemption from Puerto Rico municipal income  
   taxes to June 2006. These subsidiaries have elected, pursuant to Section
   936 of the Internal Revenue Code, to receive credits equivalent to the
   amount of Federal income taxes which would otherwise be due on their     
   income.  The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 imposes new        
   limitations on computing the Possession Tax Credit under Section 936 for
   tax years beginning after 1993.  In addition, the Act makes the 100%   
   dividends received deduction subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax        
   calculation.  

   Dividends, if paid by the Puerto Rico based subsidiaries, are subject to
   a withholding tax of 10%; however, no taxes have been provided on their
   aggregate undistributed earnings of approximately $2,458,000 at June 30,
   1995 because it is management's intention to reinvest such earnings
   indefinitely.

NOTE 4 - Income Taxes (Continued):

       A reconciliation between the expected tax expense at the statutory
       federal income tax rate and the Company's actual income tax expense
       is as follows:
       
                                                        June 30,

 At June 30, 1995, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of
 approximately $5,410,000 for federal income tax purposes.  Such 
 carryforwards expire in 2005 through 2009.  As a result of the public    
 stock offering in April 1994 (Note 7), the amount of the loss        
 carryforwards which can be utilized to offset future taxable income will
 be limited to approximately $380,000 a year, plus any loss carryforwards   
 incurred after April 19, 1994.  However, to the extent such annual        
 limitation is not utilized in any year, it may be further carried        
 forward until the carryforward would have otherwise expired.         
 Accordingly, carryforwards available to be utilized for the year ending  
 June 30, 1996 approximate $1,584,000.

NOTE 5 - Loans Payable:

  The Company's line of credit agreement, which expires in October 1996,
  with Congress Financial Corporation ("Congress") provides for borrowings
  up to $5,750,000 with interest payable monthly at 2 1/2% above the prime
  rate, plus an unused line fee of 1/4% a year.  Borrowings are limited to
  80% of eligible accounts receivable and 50% of eligible inventory up to
  a maximum inventory of $2,875,000.  The loan is subject to certain working
  capital and net worth requirements and is collateralized by all assets of
  the Company not previously pledged under other loan agreements.  The loan
  agreement prohibits the payment of dividends by the Company.  In September
  1993, Congress sold to three individuals, who are officers and directors
  of the Company, a $250,000 junior participation in the loans made to the
  Company.  The Company had an informal agreement with Congress, whereby
  Congress agreed to provide the Company an additional $500,000 in borrowing
  availability which was repaid at $11,250 a week beginning November 1, 1993
  until $250,000 of additional borrowings was repaid.  Congress can, at its
  option, repurchase the junior participation if the Company has at least
  $250,000 in availability under the financing agreement; such participation
  has not been repurchased at June 30, 1995.  The participants' interest in
  the obligations, collateral and collections is subordinated to Congress.
  
  On June 28, 1995, the Company borrowed $100,000 from a bank under a 30 day
  note, which is renewable at the bank's option.  Interest is payable at 1%
  above the prime rate.

  In December 1993, the Company received a non-interest bearing loan of
  $400,000 from an underwriter as an advance against a $750,000 private
  placement bridge loan which was completed in January 1994.  Additional
  bridge loans of $375,000 and $25,000 were received in March and April
  1994, respectively.  The loans were repaid in April 1994 on the closing
  of a public offering (Note 7).  The interest on these loans was at 5% a
  year, plus the issuance of $575,000 of the Company's common stock upon the
  closing of the public offering.  The costs incurred in connection with the
  issuance of the notes of approximately $160,000, together with the
  $575,000 value of the 287,500 shares of the Company's common stock issued
  to the note holders was charged to operations and included with interest
  expense during the year ended June 30, 1994.

NOTE 6 - Long-Term Debt:

  Long-term debt at June 30, 1995 consists of a mortgage payable, collater-
  alized by land, building, accounts receivable and personal property, with   
 
  interest at 14.0%.  In June 1992, a group of investors, including the
  spouses of certain officers and directors of the Company, acquired the
  mortgage on the Company's building with a balance of approximately
  $962,000 and $500,000 of subordinated debt from a bank for $650,000.  The
  group entered into a modification of indebtedness agreement which reduced
  the mortgage to $650,000 and forgave the balance, which, after the write
  off of related deferred financing costs, resulted in a gain of $722,000
  in fiscal 1992.  In connection with this transaction, the Company also
  issued five-year warrants to acquire 108,333 shares of common stock at
  $3.00 a share.  In January 1995, the Company reduced the exercise price
  to $1.30 and extended the expiration date until April 1999.  The mortgage
  is payable in monthly installments of $10,092, including interest, with
  the remaining balance of approximately $434,000 due in July 1997. 
  Interest on the mortgage was $78,682 and $84,195 for the years ended June
  30, 1995 and 1994, respectively, approximately 31% of which is applicable
  to the spouses of the officers and directors of the Company.

  In June 1993, the Company borrowed $325,000 from Scorpio Partners L.P.
  ("Scorpio") in the form of a convertible subordinated note, payable in
  June 1997.  In connection with the note, the Company also sold to Scorpio
  for $25,000 and $15,000, respectively, warrants to purchase 400,000 shares
  of the Company's common stock at $2.00 a share and 250,000 shares of
  common stock at $3.00 a share.

  In January 1994, the Scorpio loan was renegotiated (whereby the first
  warrant was purchased by a corporate officer/director and extended to
  March 31, 1997 and the second warrant was purchased by the Company and
  canceled) in consideration for the issuance of common stock having a total
  value of $175,000 on the effective date of a public offering.  In April
  1994, the Scorpio loan was repaid upon the closing of the public offering. 
  The $10,500 par value of the shares issued to repurchase the warrants was
  charged against additional paid-in capital in the year ended June 30,
  1994.  The finance costs of approximately $77,000 incurred in connection
  with these loans were charged to operations during the year ended June 30,
  1994 and are included with interest expense on the statement of operations. 
 
 Two partners of Scorpio were officer/directors of the Company from
  June 29, 1993 until January 1994 and June 1994.  Interest paid on the note
  during the year ended June 30, 1994 was $20,346.

NOTE 7 - Shareholders' Equity:

  Common Stock:

  In April 1991, the Company sold, pursuant to a rights offering, 480,065
  shares of common stock.  In this connection, the underwriter was sold a
  warrant to purchase 40,782 shares of common stock at $5.33 per share,
  which is exercisable until February 28, 1996.  The Company also had
  borrowed $200,000 with interest at 17% per annum during February 1991 from
  five unrelated parties.  These loans were repaid out of the proceeds of
  the rights offering, including interest.  In connection with these loans,
  the Company issued warrants to purchase 8,333 shares of common stock,
  exercisable at $3.00 per share until May 13, 1996.  In January 1995, the
  Company reduced the exercise price of the above warrants to $1.30 and
  extended their expiration dates until April 1999.

  On April 19, 1994, the Company sold in a public offering 2,000,000 units
  at $2.00 per unit.  Each unit consists of one share of the Company's
  common stock and one Class A warrant.  Each warrant entitled the holder
  to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $2.40 a
  share, from April 12, 1995 through April 12, 1999.  In January 1995, the
  Company reduced the exercise price to $1.30 a share. These warrants are
  redeemable by the Company commencing April 12, 1995 at $.10 a warrant,
  provided that the high bid price of its stock is at least $1.95 for the
  required number of days prior to the Notice of Redemption.  The Company
  also granted to the underwriter an option to purchase, at the same price,
  300,000 units to cover over-allotments.  This option was exercised in May
  1994.  The net proceeds to the Company of these sales were $3,445,520. 
  Out of these proceeds, the bridge loans (Note 5) of $1,150,000 plus
  interest and the Scorpio loan (Note 6) of $325,000 plus interest were
  repaid.  In addition, the Company sold to the underwriter for $10 an
  option, exercisable from April 12, 1995 to April 12, 1999, to purchase
  230,000 additional units at $2.90 a unit and entered into a two year
  consulting agreement with the underwriter at a total cost of $72,000. 
  Subsequent to the public offering, two officers of the underwriter became
  directors of the Company until their resignations on July 10, 1995 (see
  Note 12).

  Incentive Stock Option Plans:

  Under the Company's 1983 Incentive Stock Option Plan, options could be
  granted to June 23, 1993 for a maximum of 56,250 shares of the Company's
  common stock.  At June 30, 1995, options to purchase 8,654   shares at
  $2.67 to $3.00 a share are outstanding; no further options may be granted
  under this plan.

  Incentive Stock Option Plans (Continued):

  The Company's 1992 Incentive Stock Option Plan provides for the granting
  of options for 200,000 shares of the Company's common stock to December
  20, 2002.

  The Company's 1994 Incentive Stock Option Plan provides for the granting
  of options for 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock to January
  2004.

  Options granted under the incentive stock option plans must be exercised
  within such period as stated in the plans and, in any event, must be
  exercised no later than ten years after the date they are granted.  The
  plans provide that the exercise price of the options may not be less than
  100% of the fair market value of common stock at the date of grant or 110%
  in the case of an incentive stock option granted to any employee owning
  more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company.

  On January 20, 1995, the Board of Directors granted to the Company's
  president and two vice-presidents ten-year nonqualified options to
  purchase 400,000 shares each at $1.06 per share.  The options are exercis-
  able after five years but may become exercisable sooner upon the Company

NOTE 11 - Litigation:

  At June 30, 1995, the Company is a defendant in approximately 250 law-
  suits, together with a multitude of other defendants, in actions alleging
  exposure by approximately 480 first party plaintiffs to asbestos and
  products containing asbestos sold by the Company over unspecified periods
  of time.

  To June 30, 1995 and since 1981, the Company estimates approximately  830
  actions on behalf of approximately 6,400 first party plaintiffs have been
  instituted against it concerning asbestos related claims and that claims
  of approximately 5,920 plaintiffs have been terminated. The foregoing
  numbers assume the consummation of pending settlements. The Company
  estimates that with the exception of defense costs, a total of approximately 
  $1,300,000 has been agreed to in settlements to date with regard
  to the terminated actions of which all but $25,000 has been paid by 
  the Company's insurance carriers. The Company has been notified that for 
  actions terminated subsequent to June 30, 1995, its ahre of the settlements
  made will be approximately $15,000. To June 30, 1995, the Company
  has paid less than $40,000 for legal and defense costs to counsel
  appointed by the insurance companies to defend it.  The Company entered
  into an agreement with its primary insurance companies, wherein its
  liability is limited to 12% of the cost of the defense liability and 17%
  of the settlement claim of certain litigation.  The agreement, which is
  subject to policy limitations on each insurance policy, may be terminated
  at any time upon 90 days notice by any of the parties provided that
  termination may not be effective as to any asbestos action that has
  already been placed on the trial calendar, unless it has a scheduled
  trial date more than 12 months from the date the notice is given.  In May
  1991, the Company reached an agreement with Mount Vernon Fire Insurance
  Company, one of its primary insurance carriers, with respect to its pend-
  ing and future asbestos litigation.  Mount Vernon agreed to contribute
  6.25% to the Company's defense costs and 6.25% to its indemnity costs for
  so long a period of time as $100,000 in aggregate has not been paid for
  indemnity costs.  This agreement applied only during the period Mount
  Vernon provided insurance coverage, which is between April 1, 1968 to
  April 1, 1969.  However, because past results of settlements and defense
  costs are not necessarily indicative of future settlements and defense
  costs and because, as of this date, management is still unable to fully
  ascertain the extent of insurance coverage applicable to asbestos claims
  against the Company or the extent to which insurance carriers will
  provide coverage, neither management nor counsel is able to predict the
  outcome of these matters or the range of any potential liability that
  might result.  In addition, based on past history, management believes
  it is likely that there will be additional asbestos action instituted
  against the Company.

NOTE 11 - Litigation (Continued):

  The Company is party to other product liability litigation arising in the
  ordinary course of business.  After consultation with counsel, the
  Company considers that its ultimate liability, if any, after available
  insurance coverage, in the majority of these matters, would not have a
  material adverse effect upon the Company's financial position.  However,
  there can be no assurances that the Company's insurance coverage will
  adequately cover these cases or whether the Company's insurance will
  provide coverage for punitive damages should they be awarded.
  

NOTE 12 - Subsequent Events:

  On July 10, 1995, the Company issued 100,000 shares of common stock to
  the underwriter of its 1994 public stock offering in exchange for the
  cancellation of all of its rights under the Underwriting Agreement.  The
  Company has agreed to register these shares with the Securities and
  Exchange Commission by October 31, 1995 or to issue an additional 50,000
  shares to the underwriter and register all of the shares thereafter.

  On July 26, 1995, the Company issued to its investment advisor, which a
  new diretor of the Company is a consultant to, a five year warrant to
  purchase 125,000 shares of the Company for $1.25 a share.

                            EXHIBIT 4.5

     OPTION AGREEMENT granted as of the 20th day of January, 1995
between EASTCO INDUSTRIAL SAFETY CORP., a New York corporation with
offices at 130 West 10th Street, Huntington Station, New York 11746
(hereinafter the "Company") (which includes its subsidiaries) and
______________, residing at ____________________________________
(hereinafter the "Optionee").

     WHEREAS, the Company has begun to achieve a dramatic turnaround 
in its financial condition, 

     WHEREAS, the Optionee has heretofore taken substantial
reductions in salary, given up options and made numerous sacrifices
in order to achieve such turnaround,

     WHEREAS, the Company acknowledges that such financial
turnaround can be traced to the efforts and leadership of the
Optionee,

     WHEREAS, the Company desires to restore an option to the
Optionee, but only on the condition that the Company be profitable
for fiscal 1995 and 1996, and

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants contained
herein it is agreed as follows:

     1.   Grant.    The Company hereby grants the Optionee 
options to purchase up to 400,000 shares of common stock of the
Company, par value $0.12 per share ("Common Stock").

     2.   Exercise Price.     The exercise price of the option
shall be $1.0625 per share (the "Exercise Price"), subject to 
adjustment  as provided hereunder.  The purchase price may be paid 
for in whole or in part in any combinatin of the following: cash;
an exchange of stock valued at the average closing price for the 
ten (10) day period ending five (5) days prior to the exercise (the 
"Closing Price"); and/or by a "Cashless Exercise" in the manner 
described herein.

     If the Optionee elects to utilize a Cashless Exercise, he shall be 
entitled to a credit equal to the amount of that equity by which 
the Closing Price exceeds the Exercise Price on that number of 
options surrendered and to utilize that credit to exercise additional 
options held by him that such equity could purchase.  There shall be 
canceled that number of options utilized for the credit and for the 
options exercised for such credit.   For example, if the Optionee has 
options to acquire 200,000 shares which are exerciseable, the Closing 
Price is $2.0625 per share, the Exercise Price is $1.0625 per share 
and the Optionee elects to utilize for a credit options to acquire 
100,000 ($100,000), then upon a Cashless Exercise in connection 
therewith he shall be entitled to acquire 94,118 shares of Common 
Stock in exchange for the options for 100,000 shares of Common Stock 
for which a credit has been received and options for 94,118 shares that 
have been exercised.  The Optionee will still have exercisable options 
to acquire 5,882 shares of Common Stock.

     It shall be a condition to the obligation of the Company to issue<PAGE>
<PAGE>

shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of an option, that the
Optionee pay to the Company upon its demand, such amount as may be
requested by the Company for the purpose of satisfying any
liability to withhold federal, state, local and foreign income or
other taxes.  If the amount requested is not paid, the Company may
refuse to issue shares of Common Stock.

     3.   Adjustment Provision.  In the event that any recapitalization, or 
reclassification, split-up, stock dividend or consolidation of shares of Common 
Stock shall be affected, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are, 
in connection with a merger or consolidation of the Company or a sale by the
Company of all or a part of its assets, exchanged for a different number or 
class of shares of stock or other securities of any other corporation, or
new, different or additional shares or other securities of the
Company or of another corporation are received by the holder of
Common Stock or any distribution is made to the holders of Common
Stock other than a cash dividend, (a) the number and class of
shares or other securities that may be issued or transferred and
(b) the option price shall in each case be proportionately adjusted
as the board of directors of the Company, in the reasonable
exercise of its discretion, determine.

     4.   Term.  The options shall be exercisable for a period of
ten (10) years commencing on January 20, 1995 and shall expire on
January 19, 2005.

     5    Exercisability.  The options shall not be exercisable for
a period of five (5) years except as follows:

          5.1  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995, should the
Company attain an audited annual pre-tax income of at least
$50,000, options to purchase up to 200,000 shares of Common Stock
shall then become immediately exercisable.

          5.2  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996, should the
Company attain an audited annual pre-tax income of at least
$250,000, options to purchase up to 200,000 shares of Common Stock
shall then become immediately exercisable.

          5.3  If the Company fails to attain the $50,000 plateau
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995, should the Company's
combined pre-tax income for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1995
and 1996 exceed $300,000, then options to purchase up to 4000,000
shares of Common Stock shall then become immediately exercisable.

          5.4  Audited annual pre-tax income shall be as determined
in the Company's filing under form 10k or other comparable annual

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

report to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for
the Company or any successor to the Company.

          5.5  The option shall only be exercisable by the
Optionee, except in the event of the Optionee's death during the
term of this option grant, a duly authorized representative of the
Optionee's estate may exercise such option.

          5.6  The Common Stock issued to the Optionee upon the
exercise of this option is deemed "restricted securities" as the
term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Act"), and may only be sold pursuant to a registration under the
Act, in compliance with Rule 144 under the Act, pursuant to another
exemption therefrom or pursuant to an opinion of counsel satisfactory 
to the Employer that registration under the Act is not required.

     6.   Notices.  All notices or demands required or given under
this Option Agreement shall be in writing and sent by registered
mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the addresses
hereinabove set forth or to such other addresses as any of the
parties hereto may designate in writing, transmitted by registered
mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the other.

     7.   Severability.  The parties agree that if any term or provision
of this Agreement contravenes or is invalid under any federal, state or
local law, this Agreement shall be construed as if it did not contain 
the offending term or provision, and the remaining provisions of this

          10.  Termination.  

               a.   Termination by Employer 
               
                    (i)  Employer may terminate this Agreement 
upon written notice for Cause.  For purposes hereof, "Cause" shall
mean (A) engaging by the Employee in conduct that constitutes
activity in competition with Employer; (B) the conviction of
Employee for the commission of a felony; and/or (C) the habitual
abuse of alcohol or controlled substances.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 10(a)(i), Employer may not
terminate Employee's employment under this Agreement for Cause
unless Employee shall have first received notice from the Board
advising Employee of the specific acts or omissions alleged to
constitute Cause, and such acts or omissions continue after
Employee shall have had a reasonable opportunity (at least 10 days
from the date Employee receives the notice from the Board) to
correct the acts or omissions so complained of.  In no event shall
alleged incompetence of Employee in the performance of Employee's
duties be deemed grounds for termination for Cause.
                                             
                    (ii) Employer may terminate Employee's
employment under this Agreement if, as a result of any physical or
mental disability, Employee shall fail or be unable to perform his
duties under this Agreement for any consecutive period of 120 days
during any twelve-month period.  If Employee's employment is
terminated under this Section 10(a)(ii):  (A) for the first six
months after termination, Employee shall be paid 100% of his full
compensation under Section 4(a) of this Agreement at the rate in
effect on the date of termination, and in each successive 12 month
period thereafter Employee shall be paid an amount equal to 65% of
his compensation under Section 4(a) of this agreement at the rate
in effect on the date of termination, on an after-tax basis, which
obligation Employer may fulfill in whole or in part by purchasing
disability insurance coverage; (B) Employer's obligation to pay
life insurance premiums on the policy referred to in Section 4(c)
shall continue in effect until five years from the date of
termination; and (C) Employee shall continue to be entitled,
insofar as is permitted under applicable insurance policies or
plans, to such general medical and employee benefit plans (including 
profit sharing or pension plans) as Employee had been entitled
to on the date of termination.  Employer shall purchase disability
insurance for the benefit of Employee and any amounts payable by
Employer to Employee under this paragraph shall be reduced by the
amount of any disability payments paid by said insurance and
actually received by Employee.  

                    (iii)      This agreement automatically shall
terminate upon the death of Employee, except that Employee's estate<PAGE>
<PAGE>

shall be entitled to receive the pro-rata amount payable under any
profit sharing plans Employer may institute for the period prior to
Employee's death and any other amount to which Employee was
entitled at the time of his death and Employee's salary and all
health, insurance and other benefits applicable to Employee's
family shall continue for 12 months from the date of Employee's
death.  In addition upon the death of Employee all Rights, as
hereinafter defined, shall become vested, accelerate and become
immediately exercisable for one year at 50% of their stated
exercise price which may be paid for as described in Section 4.h.,
above.
          
               b.   Termination by Employee
                    
                    (i)  Employee shall have the right to terminate
his employment under this Agreement upon 30 days' notice to Company
given within 90 days following the occurrence of any of the
following events (A) through (F) or within three (3) years
following the occurrence of event (G):

                         (A)  Employee is not elected or retained
as President and a Director of Employer.

                         (B)  Employer acts to materially reduce
Employee's duties and responsibilities hereunder.  
                    
                         (C)  Employer acts to change the geographic location 
of the performance of Employee's duties from the
New York Metropolitan area.  For purposes of this Agreement, the
New York Metropolitan area shall be deemed to be the area within 30
road miles of Employer's present offices.
                         
                         (D)  a Material Reduction (as hereinafter
defined) in Employee's rate of base compensation, or Employee's
other benefits.  "Material Reduction" shall mean a ten percent
(10%) differential;

                         (E)  a failure by Employer to obtain the
assumption of this Agreement by any successor;

                         (F)  a material breach of this Agreement
by Employer, which is not cured within thirty (30) days of written
notice by Employee of such breach.

                         (G)  a "Change of Control" by which a
person (other than a person who is an officer and a Director of
Employer on the effective date hereof), including a "group" as
defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
becomes, or obtains the right to become, the beneficial owner of
Employer securities having 20% or more of the combined voting power
of the then outstanding securities of the Employer that may be cast
for the election of directors of the Employer (other than as a
result of an issuance of securities initiated by the Employer in
the ordinary course of business) or the composition of the Board of<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Employer changes so that officers of Employer no longer hold a
majority of the seats; or

                    (ii) Anything herein to the contrary 
notwithstanding, Employee may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30)
days written notice.  
               
               c.   If Employer shall terminate Employee's
employment other than due to his death or disability or for Cause
(as defined in Section 10(a)(i) of this Agreement), or if Employee
shall terminate this Agreement under Section 10(b)(i), Employer's
obligations under Section 4 shall be absolute and unconditional and
not subject to any offset or counterclaim and Employee shall
continue to be entitled to receive all amounts provided for by
Section 4 and all additional employee benefits under Section 4
regardless of the amount of compensation he may earn with respect
to any other employment he may obtain.  
                    
          11.  Consequences of Breach by Employer; Employment
Termination.  
               
               a.   If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10(b)(i)(A)-(F) hereof, or if Employer shall terminate
Employee's employment under this Agreement in any way that is a
breach of this Agreement by Employer, the following shall apply:

                    (i)  Employee shall receive as a bonus, and in
addition to his salary continuation pursuant to Section 10(c), a
cash payment equal to Employee's total base salary plus projected
expenses and bonuses for the remainder of the term hereof, payable
within 30 days of the date of such termination.

                    (ii) Employee shall be entitled to payment of
any previously declared bonus as provided in Section 4 above.

                    (iii)      All stock options, warrants and
stock appreciation rights ("Rights") granted by Employer to
Employee under any plan or otherwise prior to the date of 
termination shall become vested, accelerate and become immediately
exercisable; where relevant at an exercise price of $0.10 per share. 
In the event Employee owns or is entitled to receive any 
unregistered securities of Employer, then Employer shall use its best
efforts to affect the registration of all such securities as soon
as practicable, but no later than 120 days after the effective date
of termination registration statement; provided, however, that such
period may be extended or delayed by Employer for one period of up
to 60 days if, upon the advice of counsel at the time such
registration is required to be filed, or at the time Employer is
required to exercise its best efforts to cause such registration
statement to become effective, such delay is advisable and in the
best interests of Employer because of the existence of non-public
material information, or to allow Employer to complete any pending
audit of its financial statements.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

               b.   In the event of termination of Employee's
employment by Employer, other than pursuant to Section 10(a) of
this Agreement, or by Employee pursuant to Section 10(b)(i) of this
Agreement, or in the event Employer delays for more than 15 days
the making of any payment hereunder, without in any way excusing
Employer's obligations under this Agreement, the provisions of
Section 9 shall not apply to Employee.

          12.  Remedies

               Employer recognizes that because of Employee's
special talents, stature and opportunities in the industry, in the
event of termination by Employer hereunder (except under Section
10(a)(i) or (iii), or in the event of termination by Employee under
Section 10(b)(i) before the end of the agreed term, Company
acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Agreement
regarding further payments of base salary, bonuses and the
exercisability of stock options, warrants and stock appreciation
rights constitute fair and reasonable provisions for the 
consequences of such termination, do not constitute a penalty, and such
payments and benefits shall not be limited or reduced by amounts
Employee might earn or be able to earn from any other employment of
ventures during the remainder of the agreed term of this Agreement.

          13.  Excise Tax.    In the event that any payment or
benefit received or to be received by Employee in connection with
a termination of his employment with Employer would constitute a
"parachute payment" within the meaning of Code Section 280G or any
similar or successor provision to 280G and/or would be subject to
any excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999 of the Code or any
similar or successor provision then Employer shall assume all
liability for the payment of any such tax and Employer shall
immediately reimburse Employee on a "grossed-up" basis for any
income taxes attributable to Employee by reason of such Employer
payment and reimbursements.

          14.  Arbitration.   Any controversies between Employer
and Employee involving the construction or application of any of
the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement, save and
except for any breaches arising out of Sections 8 and 9 hereof,
shall on the written request of either party served on the other by
submitted to arbitration.  Such arbitration shall comply with and
be governed by the rules of the American Arbitration Association. 
An arbitration demand must be made within one (1) year of the date
on which the party demanding arbitration first had notice of the
existence of the claim to be arbitrated, or the right to 
arbitration along with such claim shall be considered to have been waived. 
An arbitrator shall be selected according to the procedures of the
American Arbitration Association.  the cost of arbitration shall be
born by the losing party or in such proportions as the arbitrator
shall decide.  The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to,
subtract from or otherwise modify the provisions of this Agreement,
or to award punitive damages to either party.

<PAGE>
          
          15.  Attorneys' Fees and Costs.  If any action at law or
in equity is necessary to enforce or interpret the terms of this
Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney's fees, costs and necessary disbursements in addition to
any other relief to which he may be entitled.

          16.  Entire Agreement; Survival.  

               a.   This Agreement contains the entire agreement
between the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated
herein and supersedes, as of the effective date hereof any prior
agreement or understanding between Employer and Employee with
respect to Employee's employment by Employer.  The unenforceability
of any provision of this Agreement shall not effect the 
enforceability of any other provision.  This Agreement may not be amended
except by an agreement in writing signed by the Employee and the
Employer, or any waiver, change, discharge or modification as
sought.  Waiver of or failure to exercise any rights provided by
this Agreement and in any respect shall not be deemed a waiver of
any further or future rights.

               b.   The provisions of Sections 4, 8, 9, 10(a)(ii),
10(c), 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 and 20 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

          17.  Assignment.    This Agreement shall not be assigned
to other parties, but shall be binding upon any purported 
successors and assigns of Employer.

(A) engaging by the Employee in conduct that constitutes activity
in competition with Employer; (B) the conviction of Employee for
the commission of a felony; and/or (C) the habitual abuse of

Cause, and such acts or omissions continue after Employee shall
have had a reasonable opportunity (at least 10 days from the date
Employee receives the notice from the Board) to correct the acts or
omissions so complained of.  In no event shall alleged incompetence
of Employee in the performance of Employee's duties be deemed
grounds for termination for Cause.
                                             
                    (ii) Employer may terminate Employee's
employment under this Agreement if, as a result of any physical or
mental disability, Employee shall fail or be unable to perform his
duties under this Agreement for any consecutive period of 120 days
during any twelve-month period.  If Employee's employment is
terminated under this Section 10(a)(ii):  (A) for the first six
months after termination, Employee shall be paid 100% of his full
compensation under Section 4(a) of this Agreement at the rate in
effect on the date of termination, and in each successive 12 month
period thereafter Employee shall be paid an amount equal to 65% of
his compensation under Section 4(a) of this agreement at the rate
in effect on the date of termination, on an after-tax basis, which
obligation Employer may fulfill in whole or in part by purchasing
disability insurance coverage; (B) Employer's obligation to pay
life insurance premiums on the policy referred to in Section 4(c)
shall continue in effect until five years from the date of
termination; and (C) Employee shall continue to be entitled,
insofar as is permitted under applicable insurance policies or
plans, to such general medical and employee benefit plans 
(including profit sharing or pension plans) as Employee had been entitled
to on the date of termination.  Employer shall purchase disability
insurance for the benefit of Employee and any amounts payable by
Employer to Employee under this paragraph shall be reduced by the
amount of any disability payments paid by said insurance and
actually received by Employee.  <PAGE>

                    (iii)     This agreement automatically shall
terminate upon the death of Employee, except that Employee's estate

profit sharing plans Employer may institute for the period prior to
Employee's death and any other amount to which Employee was
entitled at the time of his death, and Employee's salary and all
health, insurance and other benefits applicable to Employee's
family shall continue for 12 months from the date of Employee's

                         (C)  Employer acts to change the

                         (D)  a Material Reduction (as hereinafter

other benefits.  "Material Reduction" shall mean a ten percent

                         (E)  a failure by Employer to obtain the

notice by Employee of such breach.

                         (G)  a "Change of Control" by which a
person (other than a person who is an officer and a Director of
Employer on the effective date hereof), including a "group" as
defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
becomes, or obtains the right to become, the beneficial owner of
Employer securities having 20% or more of the combined voting power
of the then outstanding securities of the Employer that may be cast
for the election of directors of the Employer (other than as a<PAGE>
<PAGE>

result of an issuance of securities initiated by the Employer in
the ordinary course of business) or the composition of the Board of
Employer changes so that officers of Employer no longer hold a
majority of the seats; or

                    (ii) Anything herein to the contrary 
notwithstanding, Employee may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30)
days written notice.  
               
               c.   If Employer shall terminate Employee's
employment other than due to his death or disability or for Cause
(as defined in Section 10(a)(i) of this Agreement), or if Employee
shall terminate this Agreement under Section 10(b)(i), Employer's
obligations under Section 4 shall be absolute and unconditional and
not subject to any offset or counterclaim and Employee shall
continue to be entitled to receive all amounts provided for by
Section 4 and all additional employee benefits under Section 4
regardless of the amount of compensation he may earn with respect
to any other employment he may obtain.  
                    
          11.  Consequences of Breach by Employer; Employment
Termination.  
               
               a.   If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10(b)(i)(A)-(F) hereof, or if Employer shall terminate
Employee's employment under this Agreement in any way that is a
breach of this Agreement by Employer, the following shall apply:

                    (i)  Employee shall receive as a bonus, and in
addition to his salary continuation pursuant to Section 10(c), a
cash payment equal to Employee's total base salary plus projected
expenses and bonuses for the remainder of the term hereof, payable
within 30 days of the date of such termination.

                    (ii) Employee shall be entitled to payment of
any previously declared bonus as provided in Section 4 above.

                    (iii)     All stock options, warrants and stock
appreciation rights ("Rights") granted by Employer to Employee
under any plan or otherwise prior to the date of termination shall
become vested, accelerate and become immediately exercisable; where
relevant at an exercise price of $0.10 per share.  In the event
Employee owns or is entitled to receive any unregistered securities
of Employer, then Employer shall use its best efforts to affect the
registration of all such securities as soon as practicable, but no
later than 120 days after the effective date of termination
registration statement; provided, however, that such period may be
extended or delayed by Employer for one period of up to 60 days if,
upon the advice of counsel at the time such registration is
required to be filed, or at the time Employer is required to
exercise its best efforts to cause such registration statement to
become effective, such delay is advisable and in the best interests
of Employer because of the existence of non-public material
information, or to allow Employer to complete any pending audit of
its financial statements.<PAGE>
<PAGE>

               b.   In the event of termination of Employee's
employment by Employer, other than pursuant to Section 10(a) of
this Agreement, or by Employee pursuant to Section 10(b)(i) of this
Agreement, or in the event Employer delays for more than 15 days
the making of any payment hereunder, without in any way excusing
Employer's obligations under this Agreement, the provisions of
Section 9 shall not apply to Employee.

          12.  Remedies

               Employer recognizes that because of Employee's
special talents, stature and opportunities in the industry, in the
event of termination by Employer hereunder (except under Section
10(a)(i) or (iii), or in the event of termination by Employee under
Section 10(b)(i) before the end of the agreed term, Company
acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Agreement
regarding further payments of base salary, bonuses and the
exercisability of stock options, warrants and stock appreciation
rights constitute fair and reasonable provisions for the 
consequences of such termination, do not constitute a penalty, and such
payments and benefits shall not be limited or reduced by amounts
Employee might earn or be able to earn from any other employment of
ventures during the remainder of the agreed term of this Agreement.

          13.  Excise Tax.    In the event that any payment or
benefit received or to be received by Employee in connection with
a termination of his employment with Employer would constitute a
"parachute payment" within the meaning of Code Section 280G or any
similar or successor provision to 280G and/or would be subject to
any excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999 of the Code or any
similar or successor provision then Employer shall assume all
liability for the payment of any such tax and Employer shall
immediately reimburse Employee on a "grossed-up" basis for any
income taxes attributable to Employee by reason of such Employer
payment and reimbursements.

          14.  Arbitration.   Any controversies between Employer
and Employee involving the construction or application of any of
the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement, save and
except for any breaches arising out of Sections 8 and 9 hereof,

existence of the claim to be arbitrated, or the right to 
arbitration along with such claim shall be considered to have been waived. 
An arbitrator shall be selected according to the procedures of the
American Arbitration Association.  the cost of arbitration shall be
born by the losing party or in such proportions as the arbitrator
shall decide.  The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to,
subtract from or otherwise modify the provisions of this Agreement,
or to award punitive damages to either party.

in equity is necessary to enforce or interpret the terms of this
Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney's fees, costs and necessary disbursements in addition to
any other relief to which he may be entitled.

          16.  Entire Agreement; Survival.  

               a.   This Agreement contains the entire agreement
between the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated
herein and supersedes, as of the effective date hereof any prior
agreement or understanding between Employer and Employee with
respect to Employee's employment by Employer.  The unenforceability
of any provision of this Agreement shall not effect the 
enforceability of any other provision.  This Agreement may not be amended
except by an agreement in writing signed by the Employee and the
Employer, or any waiver, change, discharge or modification as
sought.  Waiver of or failure to exercise any rights provided by
this Agreement and in any respect shall not be deemed a waiver of
any further or future rights.

10(c), 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 and 20 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

          17.  Assignment.    This Agreement shall not be assigned
to other parties, but shall be binding upon any purported successors 
and assigns of Employer.

officer, consultant, advisor, employee, member, inventor, or
otherwise of or through any corporation, partnership, association,

equity capital of any such competitive enterprise or business and
further provided that said competitive enterprise or business is a

          10.  Termination.  

               a.   Termination by Employer 
               
                    (i)  Employer may terminate this Agreement 
upon written notice for Cause.  For purposes hereof, "Cause" shall
mean (A) engaging by the Employee in conduct that constitutes
activity in competition with Employer; (B) the conviction of
Employee for the commission of a felony; and/or (C) the habitual
abuse of alcohol or controlled substances.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 10(a)(i), Employer may not
terminate Employee's employment under this Agreement for Cause
unless Employee shall have first received notice from the Board
advising Employee of the specific acts or omissions alleged to
constitute Cause, and such acts or omissions continue after
Employee shall have had a reasonable opportunity (at least 10 days
from the date Employee receives the notice from the Board) to
correct the acts or omissions so complained of.  In no event shall
alleged incompetence of Employee in the performance of Employee's
duties be deemed grounds for termination for Cause.
                                             
                    (ii) Employer may terminate Employee's
employment under this Agreement if, as a result of any physical or
mental disability, Employee shall fail or be unable to perform his
duties under this Agreement for any consecutive period of 120 days
during any twelve-month period.  If Employee's employment is
terminated under this Section 10(a)(ii):  (A) for the first six
months after termination, Employee shall be paid 100% of his full
compensation under Section 4(a) of this Agreement at the rate in
effect on the date of termination, and in each successive 12 month
period thereafter Employee shall be paid an amount equal to 65% of
his compensation under Section 4(a) of this agreement at the rate
in effect on the date of termination, on an after-tax basis, which
obligation Employer may fulfill in whole or in part by purchasing
disability insurance coverage; (B) Employer's obligation to pay
life insurance premiums on the policy referred to in Section 4(c)
shall continue in effect until five years from the date of
termination; and (C) Employee shall continue to be entitled,
insofar as is permitted under applicable insurance policies or
plans, to such general medical and employee benefit plans 
(including profit sharing or pension plans) as Employee had been entitled
to on the date of termination.  Employer shall purchase disability
insurance for the benefit of Employee and any amounts payable by
Employer to Employee under this paragraph shall be reduced by the
amount of any disability payments paid by said insurance and
actually received by Employee.  <PAGE>
<PAGE>

                    (iii)     This agreement automatically shall
terminate upon the death of Employee, except that Employee's estate
shall be entitled to receive the pro-rata amount payable under any
profit sharing plans Employer may institute for the period prior to
Employee's death and any other amount to which Employee was
entitled at the time of his death, and Employee's salary and all
health, insurance and other benefits applicable to Employee's
family shall continue for 12 months from the date of Employee's
death.  In addition upon the death of Employee all Rights, as
hereinafter defined, shall become vested, accelerate and become
immediately exercisable for one year at 50% of their stated
exercise price which may be paid for as described in Section 4.h.,
above. 
          
               b.   Termination by Employee
                    
                    (i)  Employee shall have the right to terminate
his employment under this Agreement upon 30 days' notice to Company
given within 90 days following the occurrence of any of the
following events (A) through (F) or within three (3) years
following the occurrence of event (G):

                         (A)  Employee is not elected or retained
as Senior Vice-President and a Director of Employer.

                         (B)  Employer acts to materially reduce
Employee's duties and responsibilities hereunder.  
                    
                         (C)  Employer acts to change the geographic 
location of the performance of Employee's duties from the
New York Metropolitan area.  For purposes of this Agreement, the
New York Metropolitan area shall be deemed to be the area within 30
road miles of Employer's present offices.
                         
                         (D)  a Material Reduction (as hereinafter
defined) in Employee's rate of base compensation, or Employee's
other benefits.  "Material Reduction" shall mean a ten percent
(10%) differential;

                         (E)  a failure by Employer to obtain the
assumption of this Agreement by any successor;

                         (F)  a material breach of this Agreement
by Employer, which is not cured within thirty (30) days of written
notice by Employee of such breach.

                         (G)  a "Change of Control" by which a
person (other than a person who is an officer and a Director of
Employer on the effective date hereof), including a "group" as
defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
becomes, or obtains the right to become, the beneficial owner of
Employer securities having 20% or more of the combined voting power
of the then outstanding securities of the Employer that may be cast
for the election of directors of the Employer (other than as a
result of an issuance of securities initiated by the Employer in<PAGE>
<PAGE>

the ordinary course of business) or the composition of the Board of
Employer changes so that officers of Employer no longer hold a
majority of the seats; or

                    (ii) Anything herein to the contrary 
notwithstanding, Employee may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30)
days written notice.  
               
               c.   If Employer shall terminate Employee's
employment other than due to his death or disability or for Cause
(as defined in Section 10(a)(i) of this Agreement), or if Employee
shall terminate this Agreement under Section 10(b)(i), Employer's
obligations under Section 4 shall be absolute and unconditional and
not subject to any offset or counterclaim and Employee shall
continue to be entitled to receive all amounts provided for by
Section 4 and all additional employee benefits under Section 4
regardless of the amount of compensation he may earn with respect
to any other employment he may obtain.  
                    
          11.  Consequences of Breach by Employer; Employment
Termination.  
               
               a.   If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10(b)(i)(A)-(F) hereof, or if Employer shall terminate
Employee's employment under this Agreement in any way that is a
breach of this Agreement by Employer, the following shall apply:

                    (i)  Employee shall receive as a bonus, and in
addition to his salary continuation pursuant to Section 10(c), a
cash payment equal to Employee's total base salary plus projected
expenses and bonuses for the remainder of the term hereof, payable
within 30 days of the date of such termination.

                    (ii) Employee shall be entitled to payment of
any previously declared bonus as provided in Section 4 above.

                    (iii)      All stock options, warrants and
stock appreciation rights ("Rights") granted by Employer to
Employee under any plan or otherwise prior to the date of 
termination shall become vested, accelerate and become immediately
exercisable; where relevant at an exercise price of $0.10 per share. 
In the event Employee owns or is entitled to receive any 
unregistered securities of Employer, then Employer shall use its best
efforts to affect the registration of all such securities as soon
as practicable, but no later than 120 days after the effective date
of termination registration statement; provided, however, that such
period may be extended or delayed by Employer for one period of up
to 60 days if, upon the advice of counsel at the time such
registration is required to be filed, or at the time Employer is
required to exercise its best efforts to cause such registration
statement to become effective, such delay is advisable and in the
best interests of Employer because of the existence of non-public
material information, or to allow Employer to complete any pending
audit of its financial statements.<PAGE>
<PAGE>

               b.   In the event of termination of Employee's
employment by Employer, other than pursuant to Section 10(a) of
this Agreement, or by Employee pursuant to Section 10(b)(i) of this
Agreement, or in the event Employer delays for more than 15 days
the making of any payment hereunder, without in any way excusing
Employer's obligations under this Agreement, the provisions of
Section 9 shall not apply to Employee.

          12.  Remedies

               Employer recognizes that because of Employee's
special talents, stature and opportunities in the industry, in the
event of termination by Employer hereunder (except under Section
10(a)(i) or (iii), or in the event of termination by Employee under
Section 10(b)(i) before the end of the agreed term, Company
acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Agreement
regarding further payments of base salary, bonuses and the
exercisability of stock options, warrants and stock appreciation
rights constitute fair and reasonable provisions for the 
consequences of such termination, do not constitute a penalty, and such
payments and benefits shall not be limited or reduced by amounts
Employee might earn or be able to earn from any other employment of
ventures during the remainder of the agreed term of this Agreement.

          13.  Excise Tax.    In the event that any payment or
benefit received or to be received by Employee in connection with
a termination of his employment with Employer would constitute a
"parachute payment" within the meaning of Code Section 280G or any
similar or successor provision to 280G and/or would be subject to
any excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999 of the Code or any
similar or successor provision then Employer shall assume all
liability for the payment of any such tax and Employer shall
immediately reimburse Employee on a "grossed-up" basis for any
income taxes attributable to Employee by reason of such Employer
payment and reimbursements.

          14.  Arbitration.   Any controversies between Employer
and Employee involving the construction or application of any of
the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement, save and
except for any breaches arising out of Sections 8 and 9 hereof,
shall on the written request of either party served on the other by
submitted to arbitration.  Such arbitration shall comply with and
be governed by the rules of the American Arbitration Association. 
An arbitration demand must be made within one (1) year of the date
on which the party demanding arbitration first had notice of the
existence of the claim to be arbitrated, or the right to arbitration 
along with such claim shall be considered to have been waived. 
An arbitrator shall be selected according to the procedures of the
American Arbitration Association.  the cost of arbitration shall be
born by the losing party or in such proportions as the arbitrator
shall decide.  The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to,
subtract from or otherwise modify the provisions of this Agreement,
or to award punitive damages to either party.

in equity is necessary to enforce or interpret the terms of this
Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney's fees, costs and necessary disbursements in addition to
any other relief to which he may be entitled.

          16.  Entire Agreement; Survival.  

               a.   This Agreement contains the entire agreement
between the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated
herein and supersedes, as of the effective date hereof any prior
agreement or understanding between Employer and Employee with
respect to Employee's employment by Employer.  The unenforceability
of any provision of this Agreement shall not effect the 
enforceability of any other provision.  This Agreement may not be amended
except by an agreement in writing signed by the Employee and the
Employer, or any waiver, change, discharge or modification as
sought.  Waiver of or failure to exercise any rights provided by
this Agreement and in any respect shall not be deemed a waiver of
any further or future rights.

               b.   The provisions of Sections 4, 8, 9, 10(a)(ii),
10(c), 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 and 20 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

          17.  Assignment.    This Agreement shall not be assigned
to other parties, but shall be binding upon any purported 
successors and assigns of Employer.

          18.  Governing Law.  This Agreement and all the 
amendments hereof, and waivers and consents with respect thereto shall
be governed by the internal laws of the state of New York, without
regard to the conflicts laws principles thereof.

Mr. Leonard A. Neuhaus
Lew Lieberbaum & Co., Inc.

Garden City, New York 11530

Dear Mr. Neuhaus:

     I am writing to confirm our agreement concerning the termination of the
relationship between Lew Lieberbaum & Co., Inc. ("Lew
Lieberbaum") and Eastco Industrial Safety Corp. ("Eastco").

     Eastco immediately will issue to Lew Lieberbaum 100,000 shares
of its common stock ($0.12 par value) and will register said stock
with the Securities and Exchange Commission at no cost to Lew
Lieberbaum through a Registration Statement to be filed by October
31, 1995.  Should the Registration Statement not be filed by that
date, Eastco will issue Lew Lieberbaum an additional 50,000 shares
of said common stock and will register all 150,000 shares as soon
as practicable.

     Lew Lieberbaum, in consideration thereof, agrees to forego and
cancel all of its rights under the Underwriting Agreement between
us dated April 12, 1994 and in connection with the bridge loans
provided to Eastco in January, March and April, 1994; including,
but not limited to:

     (1)  The termination of Lew Lieberbaum's right of first
          refusal to act on behalf of Eastco in future transactions;

     (2)  The cancellation of all Underwriter's Warrants presently
          held by Lew Lieberbaum or its affiliates, which shall be
          returned to Eastco upon receipt by Lew Lieberbaum of the
          100,000 shares referred to above;

     (3)  The registration of Messrs. Neuhaus and Lieberbaum from
          the Eastco board and the acknowledgment by Lew Lieberbaum
          that it shall have no further right to representation on
          Eastco's board, but (i) Lew Lieberbaum shall have the
          right to have an observer attend meetings of the board
          through April 30, 1997 and (ii) the board shall appoint
          two additional non-management directors to the board
          pending the next meeting of shareholders, at which time
          it shall nominate two additional non-management directors
          for election;<PAGE>

<PAGE>

heretofore terminated and settled as to Eastco prior to the date
of this Agreement ("Terminated Asbestos Actions").

            C.   This Agreement shall not be applicable to any

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

  FOURTH:   Settlement and Payment of Judgments.  

            A.  All of the litigation involving the Asbestos
Actions shall be managed in the best interests of Eastco as to
strategy.  Settlement and disposition of any of the Asbestos
Actions may be made with the consent of Eastco and the Lead
Carrier and such settlement shall be binding upon all parties

therewith ("Indemnity Costs") of all Asbestos Actions for which
this Agreement is applicable shall be paid in accordance with the
following schedule:
                                               
                 Hartford shall pay    38.67%

                 Public shall pay      11.32%     
                 Birmingham shall pay  11.32%

                 Eastco shall pay      17.00%      

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

            C.   The Indemnity Costs payable in accordance
with Section B. above shall be paid by the Lead Carrier who shall

their share and each shall reimburse the Lead Carrier within
sixty (60) days after receipt of a bill for their share.

  FIFTH:    Terminated Asbestos Actions - Pro Rata Sharing of
Legal and Indemnity Expenses by Insurance Companies.

            A.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Legal Fees and indemnity payments for all
Terminated Asbestos Actions shall be borne  in full solely by the
Insurance Companies and in proportion to their relative liability
to each other under the following schedule:
                         
                 Hartford shall pay    46.59%
                 Home shall pay         8.52%
                 Public shall pay      13.64%
                 Birmingham shall pay  13.64%
                 American shall pay    17.61%

            B.   The Insurance Companies shall reimburse each
other for such Legal Fees and indemnity payments within sixty
(60) days of the execution of this Agreement so that each
Insurance Company shall have paid Legal Fees and Indemnity Costs
for such Terminated Asbestos Actions in proportion to their pro
rata liability under Article Fifth A above.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

            C.   All Legal Fees heretofore paid with respect
to Asbestos Actions still pending shall also be shared in
accordance with the provisions of this Article FIFTH.    

  SIXTH:    Exhaustion of Limits

            A.  Payment of indemnification costs by the
Insurance Companies shall be credited towards the exhaustion of
the policy limits of their respective policies listed on Schedule
"1."

            B.   Upon exhaustion of policy limits through
payment of indemnification costs, or payments of claims of a
policy listed on Schedule "1," the Insurance Company's
obligations of defense and indemnity under the policy, and
further payments of defense costs and indemnification costs under
this Agreement, shall terminate for that policy.  Upon the
exhaustion of the policy limits under all the policies listed on
Schedule "1" for the respective Insurance Companies, the
obligations of defense and indemnity under the policies and
payment of defense costs and indemnification costs under this
Agreement shall terminate.

            C.   In the event of the exhaustion of a policy
limit by one of the Insurance Companies, the contribution
percentage shall be adjusted for all pending and future Asbestos
Actions and Eastco shall assume responsibility for the decreased
contribution percentage as applicable, by treating the exhausted

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

policy limit as a self-insured layer.  In the event of the
existence of excess liability insurance over the exhausted policy
limit of the Insurance Company, as applicable, Eastco will use
its best efforts to have such excess insurer become a signatory
to this Agreement and assume its pro rata share of
indemnification costs.  In addition, Eastco will use its best
efforts to have such excess insurer assume its pro rata share of
Legal Fees if the policy with the excess carrier so provides.  

  SEVENTH:  Reservation of Rights

            A.   This Agreement does not alter the rights or
obligations of the parties hereto under the provisions of any
applicable binder or policy of insurance.

            B.   All questions respecting insurance coverage
or lack of insurance coverage for Eastco including but not
limited to establishing the existence of or the terms, condi-
tions, exclusions, provisions or obligations of insurance
coverage or binder or policies of insurance that were or may have
been issued to Eastco or respecting the liability or non-
liability of any party thereunder or respecting the breach or
fulfillment of any term, conditions, exclusions, provision or
obligation thereof are expressly reserved as between the parties
to this Agreement.

            C.   This Agreement or performance hereunder is
not intended to and shall not be construed to operate as a waiver
or modification of any of the terms, conditions, exclusions,

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

provisions or obligations of any insurance policy that has been
or may have been issued to Eastco.  All parties reserve all
previously held positions regarding the proper interpretation and
application of terms, conditions, exclusions, provisions or
obligations of any insurance policy or binder that has been or
may have been issued to Eastco.

  EIGHTH:   Waiver of Bad Faith

  Notwithstanding any other provision, each party, as to each
other party, hereby waives and forever relinquishes any claim,
demand, right and cause of action for breach of insurance
contracts, non-contractual damages, bad faith, failure to provide
timely notice of an Asbestos Action, insurance code violations,
exemplary or punitive damages and for any other tort or statutory
liability, whether known or unknown, based upon, arising out of
or connected in any way with any acts or omissions by such other

  FIRST AMENDMENT to Defense and Indemnity Agreement dated March 26, 1990 by
and among Eastco Industrial Safety Corp. ("Eastco"), The Hartford Insurance
Group ("Hartford"), The Home Insurance Company ("Home"), Public Service Mutual
Insurance Companies ("Public"), Birmingham Fire ("Birmingham") and American
Casualty Company of Reading, Pa. ("American").

  1.   Confidentiality.  The parties agree that the terms of the Defense and
Indemnity Agreement dated March 26, 1990 (the "Agreement") will remain
confidential and will not be disclosed to a non-party, except as required in
the conduct of the disclosing parties' business, or to effectuate the
performance of this Agreement or as otherwise required by law, or in filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and communications with Eastco's
shareholders.  

  2.   Minor Departures.  The parties recognize that the implementation of
this Agreement will involve the handling of numerous claims and that minor
departures from the strict terms and conditions of the Agreement might occur
as a result.  The parties intend that minor departures by one or more parties,
such as do not evince an intent to refuse to perform under the Agreement,
shall not be considered as such a material breach of this Agreement as to
confer upon the other parties the right to terminate this Agreement.

  3.   Counterpart.  This amendment may be signed in counterpart and the
Agreement, including this amendment, shall not be binding upon any party until
each is signed by all of the parties hereto.
