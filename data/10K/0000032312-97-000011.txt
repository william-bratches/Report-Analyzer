take precedence. Acceptance of such Purchase Orders by Seller may be made by
signing and returning the attached acknowledgment copy of the Purchase Orders,

reports and documents set forth therein 

C.      Beginning with the first month following the effective date of this
Contract, Buyer shall provide to Seller on or before the first day of each
calendar month a forecast of expected Equipment and Services for the next six
months. Such forecasts for Equipment and Services are for planning purposes
only and shall not be considered a binding commitment absent a Purchase Order
issued in accordance with this Contract. 

D.      The Equipment and Services shall be sold hereunder at the prices set
forth on Schedule C, or such other prices as Seller and Buyer may agree in
writing from time to time during the term of this

E.      Buyer may at any time and from time to time, without further cost or
liability, by written notice to Seller at least _______ (______) business days
prior to a required delivery date, reschedule any Purchase Order, in whole or
in part, to a later rescheduled delivery date. 

F. _______________________________________________________________________
In the event of a cancellation of any Purchase Order or portion thereof by
Buyer for reason other than a "Force Majeure" event described in paragraph XIV
or Seller's fault hereunder, Seller may, at its election, require Buyer to pay
a cancellation charge for the Equipment and Services canceled by Buyer. Such
cancellation charge, if any, shall be determined in accordance with Schedule
D.
__________________________________________________________ Seller shall not be
paid for any work done in respect of the canceled Purchase Order after receipt
of the notice of cancellation nor for any costs or expenses of Seller or
Seller's suppliers or subcontractors which Seller could reasonably have
avoided. 



<PAGE>
In no event shall any such cancellation charge exceed the purchase price of
the Equipment and Services canceled, nor shall any such charge apply to goods
or materials which are reasonably returnable by Seller or otherwise useable or
can be sold in the normal course of Seller's business. 

Within thirty (30) days after notice of cancellation by Buyer, Seller shall
present Buyer with a cancellation charge calculation accompanied by a
certificate signed by the Controller or other financial officer of Seller
stating that such charge properly includes all costs connected with or
incurred as a result of such cancellation. Buyer shall pay Seller for all
cancellation charges determined in accordance with Schedule D hereof within
thirty (30) days of Buyer's receipt of Seller's invoice therefor, together
with the certificate signed by the Controller or other financial officer of
Seller. Subject to Paragraph XI, title to all items of work subject to the
canceled Purchase Order, which would have been incorporated into a deliverable
item under this Contract, shall, upon payment by Buyer in full of the
cancellation charges due hereunder, vest in Buyer, and shall be tendered to a
carrier of Buyer's selection.

accordance with the required delivery dates, time being of the essence. Upon
availability for shipment from Seller's location of the Equipment purchased
hereunder, Seller shall promptly notify the carrier designated by Buyer and
tender such equipment to the carrier for shipment. Seller shall immediately
notify Buyer by telephone, with written confirmation, of the occurrence of any
delay and the period of such delay in the scheduled and or actual delivery of

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Contract, Seller acknowledges
that in the event of its failure to deliver Equipment or to perform associated
Services by the date or within the time period specified in a Purchase Order,



<PAGE>
Buyer may incur losses or damages that will be difficult or impossible to
measure or otherwise ascertain. If the delay is not due to fault of Buyer or
the occurrence of a "Force Majeure" event described in Paragraph XIV of this
Contract, Buyer may, at its option, assess Seller the late delivery penalties
listed in Schedule D to this Contract. If at any time during the term of this
Contract the Equipment or Services designated on any Purchase Order is to be
delayed or has been delayed for a period of more than _____ (____) days from
the required delivery date, and such delays are not due to fault of Buyer or
the occurrence  of  a  "Force Majeure" event  described in Paragraph XIV of
this Contract, then such delays will constitute a default in Seller's
performance of its material obligations under this Contract. 

C.      Seller shall in a timely manner duly prepare and provide to the
selected carrier and send by reliable courier to Buyer, the following for each

XIX. APPLICABLE LAW AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES

A. This Contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, including the Uniform Commercial
Code as thereby adopted, without giving effect to any choice of law or
conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws
of any other jurisdiction. 

B. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this
Contract, including any question regarding its existence, construction,
interpretation, validity, termination, whether during or after the life of
this Contract, shall be referred to and finally resolved by compulsory
arbitration, from which no appeal may be taken, under the Rules of the
American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be held in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania before three arbitrators, one arbitrator to be
appointed by each party. If a party fails to appoint its arbitrator within a
period of ten (10) business days after the other party has appointed its
arbitrator, or if the parties cannot agree on the third arbitrator within a
period of fifteen (15) business days after the appointment of the second
arbitrator, then the second arbitrator and/or the third arbitrator, as the
case may be, shall be appointed by the American Arbitration Association. 

C. The parties hereby consent that service of process in any litigation may be
served in the same manner as any notice hereunder as set forth in Paragraph
XVIII, with the exception that no notification shall be served by fax. 

D.      Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered by any court having
competent jurisdiction 

E. Nothing in this contract shall be deemed to prevent either party from
seeking injunctive relief from any judicial or administrative authority. 

XX. BINDING EFFECT

These terms and conditions shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
both parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns. Neither party
may assign any right or obligation hereunder without the other's prior written
consent except to an entity controlled by, controlling or under common control
with such party provided (i) the assignee agrees to be bound by the terms and
conditions of this Contract, and (ii) such assignment does not adversely
affect the other party's ability to exercise, and/or benefit from, its rights
under this Contract. As used herein "control" and variations thereof, shall
mean the ownership or control, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty
percent (50%) of the voting power of the shares or other ownership interests
entitled to vote for the election of directors or other governing authority.
Except as specifically

All information released to the media by Seller or Buyer relating to this

prior to its release. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall distribute any
promotional or marketing material using the name of the other party, without
the prior written consent of such party. 

XXII. AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS

Buyer reserves the right to visit Seller's facilities and to audit and inspect
Seller's books, records and operations as is reasonably necessary to verify
Seller's proper compliance with this Contract. Buyer shall give at least five

other, to provide any certifications to third parties on behalf of the other
party, nor to bind the other in any manner whatsoever.

reasonably be expected to be intended to survive any such termination.
