<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG></STRONG>	MEMS USA, Inc. (formerly LumaLite Holdings, Inc.), ("the Company") was originally
formed to hold certain mineral properties in Idaho.  In 1995, the Company's stockholders approved
the sale of the mining properties for a cash payment plus a variable production royalty tied to the
price of silver.  In 2000, the purchaser filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. code and
shut down operations.</P>

<P>	In December 2001, the Company entered into a merger agreement with LumaLite, Inc.
("LumaLite"), a California corporation that develops and manufactures dental products.  In March
2002, the Company's stockholders approved, and in April 2002 effected, a corporate name change
from "Consil Corp" to "LumaLite Holdings, Inc.," a 25 to 1 reverse split of the outstanding shares
of common stock, restated the bylaws, and changed domicile from Idaho to Nevada.  </P>

<P>	The following year the Company concluded an Exchange Agreement on March 14, 2003
which divested the Company of its subsidiary LumaLite.  As per the Exchange Agreement,
17,800,000 shares of common stock previously issued in connection with the merger was canceled
in return for all of the shares of LumaLite owned by the Company and the payment of $75,000.</P>

<P>	As a result of the above divestiture, 3,449,744 shares of common stock that were issued in
cancellation of debt in 2002, have been returned to treasury.  This resulted in $358, 773 in debt being
restated on the Company's balance sheet.</P>

<P>	In November 2003, the Company completed a restructuring of its capital through a 1:200
reverse split of its common stock.   	</P>

<P>	  Prior to December 2003, the Company was in the process of looking for business
opportunities to acquire or merge with.  In seeking a business opportunity to merge with or acquire,
management reviewed various business plans. </P>

<P>	In December 2, 2003, the Company signed a letter of intent to acquire all of the equity of
MEMS USA, Inc., ("MEMS") which is a privately-held California corporation.  Subsequent to the
year end, the Company entered into a reorganization agreement with MEMS in which MEMS
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and finalized a complete change of management.
</P>

<P>	During the fourth quarter, in anticipation of this closing the shareholders successfully
restructured approximately $360,000 in debt which was converted to approximately 3,230,000 shares
of the Company's common stock. </P>

<P>	Subsequent to year end, the Company's name was changed to MEMS USA, Inc. and as a
result of all the foregoing changes, the Company's symbol was changed to &quot;MEMS.&quot;</P>

<P>	Subsequent to the year end, the shareholders of MEMS were issued 10,000,000 shares of
common stock and have become the controlling shareholders of the Company.    </P>

which was determined, subsequent to year end, to be MEMS USA, Inc., as well as, a reverse stock
split of 200 to 1 of the Company's common stock.  The fractional shares were rounded up to the

<P>	During the preceding two fiscal years the Company has not paid any dividends on it common
stock, and the Company does not anticipate that it will pay dividends in the foreseeable future.  The
future payment of dividends, if any, on the common stock is within the discretion of the Board of
Directors and will depend on the Company's earnings, its capital requirements, and the financial
condition and other relevant factors.	 </P>

<P>	As of February 10, 2004, there were 13,385,779 shares of common stock outstanding held
by approximately 3,196 shareholders of record.

<P>	During July 2003, 11,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company were issued at par
value for a portion of expenses and obligations paid by a third party.  The balance of those expenses
have been settled in exchange for convertible notes, due on demand with an annual interest rate of
10%.<BR WP="BR2">
  </P>

<P>	Also in July 2003, 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company were issued for
services provided by the President, which services were valued at $2,000.</P>

<P>	In November 19, 2003, through a majority consent of its shareholders, the Company
completed a restructuring of its capital through a reverse split of 1:200 of its common stock with no
certificate greater than 100 shares being reversed below 100 share, and no certificate less than 100
shares being subject to the reverse.</P>

<P>	During December 2003, 10,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to a shareholder

Also, 3,230,000 shares of common stock were issued to shareholders for conversion of
$358,530 in debt.

<P>	As a result of the recission of Lumalite, a reverse split and new issuances of common stock
the Company's outstanding shares of common stock was reduced from 28,964,234 at the beginning
of 2003 to 12,342,036 at December 31, 2003.</P>

<P>	No underwriter was involved in any of the above issuances of securities. All of the above
securities were issued in reliance upon the exemptions set forth in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>ITEM 6. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND<br>
ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATIONS</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Plan of Operations </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial
statements.</P>

<P>	The Company may obtain funds in one or more private placements to finance the operation
of its newly acquired business. </P>

<P><STRONG>Results of Operations </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>The Company reported a net loss of approximately ($38,000) and ($432,165) for the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, which was due to general and administrative
expenses incurred by the Company.   The Company anticipates very little or no overhead from future
operations until a successor business can be acquired or merged.  </P>

<P>	 In connection with the 2002 merger of LumaLite, Inc., the Company converted a significant
amount of debt into shares of common stock and one of the principal shareholders contributed its
holdings to the Company's capital. </P>

<P>	During February 2003, the Company divested itself of LumaLite Inc., through an Exchange
Agreement in which LumaLite, Inc.'s shareholders agreed to cancel 17,800,000 shares of common
stock and reinstated approximately $360,000 in debt to the Company's balance sheet.</P>

<P>	During the period covered by this report, the Company conducted only minimal business
operations.  The Company currently has no employees.</P>

<BR WP="BR1">	During July 2003, 11,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company were issued at par
value for a portion of expenses and obligations paid by a third party.  The balance of those expenses
have been settled in exchange for convertible notes, due on demand with an annual interest rate of
10%.
<P>	Also, 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company were issued for services provided
by the President, which services were valued at $2,000.</P>

<P>	During the third fiscal quarter, approximately $7,320 in accounts payable were settled in
exchange for convertible notes and are reflected in that portion of the Company's financial
statements.<BR WP="BR2">
  </P>

<P>	On December 5, 2003, 10,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to a shareholder of
the Company for the assumption of $10,000 in debt.</P>

<hr color="#0000FF">

<BR WP="BR1"><STRONG>LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES</STRONG><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>The Company will need to raise additional capital through private funding to meet the
financial needs of its newly acquired business, of being a reporting company and to meet the
obligations of the current accounts payable.   Historically, the Company has been successful in
raising operational capital.  There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in obtaining
necessary funding to develop its new operation.</P>

<P>	To the extent the Company acquires the amounts necessary to fund its ongoing business plan
through the issuance of equity securities, the Company's shareholders may experience dilution in
the value per share of their equity securities.  The acquisition of funding through the issuance of debt
could result in a substantial portion of the Company's cash flow from operations being dedicated to
the payment of principal and interest on that indebtedness, and could render the Company more
vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns.<BR WP="BR2">
</P>

<P><STRONG>NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING</STRONG><BR WP="BR2">
</P>

<P>	The Company believes that its existing capital will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash
needs, including the costs of compliance with the continuing reporting requirements of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for the coming year.  There is no assurance, however, that the
available funds will ultimately prove to be adequate to allow it to complete a business combination,
and once a business combination is completed, the Company's needs for additional financing are
likely to increase substantially.  </P>

<P><STRONG>FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT</STRONG></P>

<P>	This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect Management's current
views with respect to future events and financial performance.  Those statements include statements
regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company and members of its management
team as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based.  Prospective investors are
cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and
involve risk and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated
by such forward-looking statements.  Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various
disclosures made by the Company in this report and in the Company's other reports filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Important factors currently known to Management could
cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements.  The Company
undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed
assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in the future operating results over
time.   The Company believes that its assumptions are based upon reasonable data derived from and
known about its business and operations and the business and operations of the Company.  No
assurances are made that actual results of operations or the results of the Company's future activities
will not differ materially from its assumptions.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT</P>

<BR WP="BR1">MEMS USA, Inc.<br>
(formerly LumaLite Holdings, Inc.)
<P>	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MEMS USA, Inc. (formerly
LumaLite Holdings, Inc.) as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related statements of operations,
cash flows, and stockholders' equity (deficit) for the years then ended.  These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit.</P>

<P>	We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

	In our opinion, the December 31, 2003 and 2002 financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the  financial position of MEMS USA, Inc. (formerly LumaLite Holdings,
Inc.) as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years
then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.
<P>	The accompanying financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to
the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital
deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  Management's
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.  The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</P>

(formerly LumaLite Holdings, Inc.)<br>
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<br>
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002</U></P>

<P><U>NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</U> </P>

<P>	This summary of accounting policies for MEMS USA, Inc. (formerly LumaLite Holdings,
Inc.)( the "Company") is presented to assist in understanding the Company's financial statements.
The accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles and have been
consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.</P>

<P><U>Organization and Basis of Presentation</U><BR WP="BR2">
</P>

<P>	MEMS USA, Inc. (formerly LumaLite Holdings, Inc.), ("the Company") was originally
formed to hold certain mineral properties in Idaho.  In 1995, the Company's stockholders approved
the sale of the mining properties for a cash payment plus a variable production royalty tied to the
price of silver.  In 2000, the purchaser filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. code and
shut down operations.</P>

<P>	In December 2001, the Company entered into a merger agreement with LumaLite, Inc.
("LumaLite"), a California corporation that develops and manufactures dental products.  In March
2002, the Company's stockholders approved, and in April 2002 effected, a corporate name change
from "Consil Corp" to "LumaLite Holdings, Inc.," a 25 to 1 reverse split of the outstanding shares
of common stock, restated the bylaws, and changed domicile from Idaho to Nevada.  </P>

<P>	The following year the Company concluded an Exchange Agreement on March 14, 2003
which divested the Company of its subsidiary LumaLite Inc.  As per the Exchange Agreement,
17,800,000 shares of common stock previously issued in connection with the merger was canceled
in return for all of the shares of LumaLite Inc. owned by the Company and the payment of $75,000.<BR WP="BR2">
</P>

<P>	Prior to December 2003, the Company was in the process of looking for business
opportunities to acquire or merge with.  In seeking a business opportunity to merge with or acquire,
management reviewed various business plans. </P>

<P>	in December 2, 2003, the Company signed a letter of intent to acquire all of the equity of
MEMS USA, Inc.,("MEMS") which is a privately-held California corporation.  Subsequent to the
year end, the Company entered into a reorganization agreement with MEMS in which MEMS
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and finalized a complete change of management.
</P>

<P>	Subsequent to year end, the Company's name was changed to MEMS USA, Inc. and as a
result of all the foregoing changes, the Company's common stock is traded on the National
Quotation Bureau (NQB)Pink Sheets under the symbol &quot;MEMS.&quot;</P>

(Continued)</U></P>

<P><U>Nature of Business</U> </P>

<P>	Prior to December 2003, the Company was in the process of looking for business
opportunities to acquire or merge with.  In seeking a business opportunity to merge with or acquire,
management reviewed various business plans. On January 29, 2004, the Company entered into a
Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with MEMS USA, Inc., which is a privately-held
California corporation.  </P>

<P>	MEMS USA, Inc. is a California based professional scientific and technical services
corporation.  MEMS USA, Inc. designs and builds electronic controls for industrial systems.  The
Company specializes in the design and fabrication of customized instrumentation products to
measure pressure, temperature and flow.</P>

<P>	The Company's product line includes self-contained precise hydrocarbon blending systems,
Industrial Filtration Systems (IFS), Ultrasonic sensors, chemical sensors, advanced strain gauge
sensors, alcohol purification systems and piezoelectric actuators and motors.  </P>

<P><U>Pervasiveness of Estimates</U></P>

<P>	The financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.  In preparing the financial statements, management is
required to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and statement
of operations for the year then ended.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.  Estimates are
used when accounting for allowance for bad debts, collectibility of accounts receivable, amounts due
to services providers, depreciation, and litigation contingencies, among others.  </P>

<P><U>Cash Equivalents</U> </P>

<P>	For the purpose of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with maturity of three months of less to be cash equivalents to the extent the
funds are not being held for investment purposes.  </P>

<P><U></U><U>Concentrations of Credit Risk</U></P>

<P><U>	</U>The Company has no significant off-balance-sheet concentrations of credit risk such as
foreign exchange contracts, options contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements.<U></U></P>

</U>(Continued)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><U>NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES<br>
(Continued)</U>
<P><U>Net Income (Loss) Per Share</U></P>

<P>	Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing earnings available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The
effect of outstanding common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive for 2003 and 2002 and are
thus not considered.</P>

<P><U>Reclassifications</U></P>

<P>	Certain reclassifications have been made in the 2002 financial statements to conform with
the 2003 presentation.<BR WP="BR2">
</P>

<P><U>NOTE 2 - INCOME TAXES </U><BR WP="BR2">
</P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes."  SFAS No. 109 requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future income tax consequences, based on enacted tax laws, of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.<BR WP="BR2">
</P>

<P><U></U>	As of December 31, 2003, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward for income
tax reporting purposes of approximately $606,500 that may be offset against future taxable income
through 2022.  Current tax laws limit the amount of loss available to be offset against future taxable
income when a substantial change in ownership occurs.  Therefore, the amount available to offset
future taxable income may be limited.  <U></U>Accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the loss
carryforwards are offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount.</P>

<P><U></U><U>NOTE 3 - REVERSE MERGER</U></P>

<P>	In December 2001, the Company entered into an agreement with Lumalite, Inc. ("Lumalite").
Pursuant to which a newly formed wholly owned Company subsidiary merged with and into
Lumalite (the "Merger").  In connection with the Merger, in early January 2002, the Company
completed a private placement of 12,500,000 shares of common stock with three accredited investors
for an aggregate purchase price <U></U>of $500,000.  Following the reverse split, as described below, the
three accredited investors held 500,000 shares of common stock of the Company.  The stock was
sold in  reliance on the exemption from registration provided under ss. 4(2) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended.  The proceeds from the private placement were placed in escrow and were used
primarily to pay costs and expenses associated with the Merger.</P>

<P>	As contemplated by the Merger, in March 2002, the stockholders of the Company approved
a 25 for 1 reverse split of its outstanding shares of common stock, amended and restated the </P>

<P>Company's articles and bylaws and moved the state of incorporation from Idaho to Nevada.  The
Company also changed its name to LumaLite Holdings, Inc. and, through a series of transactions,
amended and restated its articles of incorporation and its bylaws.  On April 16, 2002 the Company
completed the Merger.</P>

<P><U></U>	In the Merger, all of Lumalite's issued and outstanding shares of common stock were
canceled and converted into a right to receive 17,800,000 post reverse split common shares of the
Company (approximately 62.46% of the outstanding common stock of the Company following <U></U> the
reverse split of the common shares of the Company).</P>

<P>	In connection with the Merger, one of the Company's principal stockholders prior to the
Merger, contributed 296,732 post reverse split shares of common stock of the Company,  back to the
Company and holders of debt in the original amount of $725,000 converted the principal amount of
the debt, plus accrued interest, into 10,118,744 post reverse split shares of common stock of the
Company (approximately 35.5% of the outstanding common stock of the Company).</P>

<P>	The following year the Company concluded an Exchange Agreement on March 14, 2003
which divested the Company of its subsidiary LumaLite.  As per the Exchange Agreement,
17,800,000 shares of common stock previously issued in connection with the merger was canceled
in return for all of the shares of LumaLite owned by the Company and the payment of $75,000.</P>

<P><U></U>	As a result of the above divestiture, 3,449,744 shares of common stock that were issued in
cancellation of debt in 2002, have been returned to treasury.  This resulted in $358, 773 in debt being
restated on the Company's balance sheet.</P>

<P>	On December 2, 2003, the Company signed a letter of intent to acquire all of the equity of
MEMS USA, Inc., ("MEMS") which is a privately-held California corporation.  Subsequent to the
year end, the Company entered into a reorganization agreement with MEMS in which MEMS
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and finalized a complete change of management.&nbsp;</P>

<P>
<U>NOTE 4 - DIVESTITURE OF LUMALITE, INC.</U></P>

<P>	The Company and LumaLite concluded an Exchange Agreement on March 14<SUP></SUP>, 2003 which
effectively returns LumaLite to a non-public entity.  This action was taken due to the fact that the
Company was unable to raise the capital necessary to properly fund LumaLite and establish a liquid
market for the Company's stock.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><U>NOTE 5 - COMMON STOCK</U><BR WP="BR2">
<P><U>	</U>During July 2003, 11,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company were issued at par

<P>	Also, 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company were issued for services provided
by the President, which services were valued at $2,000.<U></U></P>

<P>	On November 19, 2003, through a majority consent of its shareholders, the Company
completed a restructuring of its capital through a reverse split of 1:200 of its common stock with no
certificate greater than 100 shares being reversed below 100 share, and no certificate less than 100
shares being subject to the reverse.</P>

<P>	During December 2003, 10,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to a shareholder
for assumption of $10,000 in debt.  Subsequent to December 31, 2003 these shares were canceled.
</P>

<P>	Also in December 2003, 3,230,000 shares of common stock were issued to shareholders for
assumption of $358,530 in debt.  <U></U></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><U>NOTE 6 - GOING CONCERN</U>
<P>	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, which contemplates the Company as a going
concern. However, the Company has sustained substantial operating losses in recent years and has
used substantial amounts of working capital in its operations.  Realization of a major portion of the </P>

<P><U></U>assets reflected on the  accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the
Company which, in turn, is  dependent upon the Company's ability to meet its financing requirements
and succeed in its future  operations.  Management believes that actions presently being taken to
revise the Company's operating and financial requirements provide them with the opportunity for
the Company to continue as a going concern. </P>

<P><U>NOTE 7 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS</U><BR WP="BR2">
</P>

<P>	On January 29, 2004, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization with MEMS USA, Inc. ("MEMS"), which is a privately-held California corporation.
The Company acquired 100 percent of the common stock of MEMS,  in exchange for 10,000,000
newly issued shares of the Company's common stock.  This transaction closed on February 18, 2004.</P>

<P>	As a result of this transaction, all of the prior officers and directors of the Company resigned
and have been replaced by Mr. Lawrence, as Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board,
<U></U>President and Chief Financial Officer, and by Mr. Daniel Moscaritolo as the Chief Operating Officer

college for a career in his family's aviation business.  After three years with the family company, Mr.
Hosking made the decision to leave and pursue aviation consulting opportunities.  From 1985 to
1994, Mr. Hosking operated a private business in Mexico.  In 1994, Mr. Hosking returned to the
United States.  Upon returning to the United States, he worked as a management and marketing
consultant to United States and Mexico companies.  In 1998, Mr. Hosking developed the business
model of iBonZai and incorporated iBonZai.com, Inc. in 1999.   </P>

<P><STRONG>Audit Committee Financial Expert</STRONG></P>

<P>	The Company's board of directors does not have an "audit committee financial expert,"
within the meaning of such phrase under applicable regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, serving on its audit committee.  The board of directors believes that all members of
its audit committee are financially literate and experienced in business matters, and that one or more
members of the audit committee are capable of (i) understanding generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") and financial statements, (ii) assessing the general application of GAAP
principles in connection with our accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves, (iii) analyzing and
evaluating our financial statements, (iv) understanding our internal controls and procedures for
financial reporting; and (v) understanding audit committee functions, all of which are attributes of
an audit committee financial expert.  However, the board of directors believes that there is not any
audit committee members who has obtained these attributes through the experience specified in the
SEC's definition of "audit committee financial expert."  Further, like many small companies, it is
difficult for the Company to attract and retain board members who qualify as "audit committee
financial experts, " and competition for these individuals is significant.  The board believes that its
current audit committee is able to fulfill its role under SEC regulations despite not having a
designated "audit committee financial expert."</P>

<P>	The Company and LumaLite concluded an Exchange Agreement on March 2003 which
divested the Company of LumaLite ownership.  This action was taken due to the fact that the
Company was unable to raise the capital necessary to properly fund LumaLite and establish a liquid
market for the Company's stock.  As a result, LumaLite incurred substantial debt that in turn had an
adverse effect on the market for the Company's stock.  Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement,
17,800,000 shares of common stock previously issued in connection with the merger was canceled
in return for all of the shares of LumaLite owned by the Company and the payment of $75,000. </P>

<P>	In the opinion of the disinterested members of the Company's board of directors, the above
transactions were fair and were made upon terms that were no less favorable to the Company than
would have been obtained if negotiated with unaffiliated third parties.</P>
