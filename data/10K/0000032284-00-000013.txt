PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

(a) Business Development

Historical

The  Registrant  was  incorporated  in New  Jersey  in  1959.  Until  1986,  the
Registrant  was  engaged in the  marketing  and sale of a line of  approximately
2,500 electronic semiconductors,  principally transistors, diodes and rectifiers
and, to a lesser extent, other ancillary related electronic products. Because of
sustained  operating loses, the Company  discontinued this line of operation and
filed a plan of  reorganization  (under  Chapter  11)  with  the  United  States
Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York, on April 30, 1990.


On September 19, 1990, and as required by the Plan, the Registrant  prepared and
forwarded to all  stockholders of record,  a notice advising  stockholders as to
the applicable terms of the Plan (the "Notice"). The operative provisions of the
Notice were as follows:

1. All theretofore  issued and  outstanding  shares of the  Registrant's  Common
Stock, $.01 par value per share, which were restricted securities were cancelled
and would not be reissued.

2. All non-legend stock  (free-trading) was also cancelled but was reissued at a
reverse-split  ratio of three new shares for every seven "old" shares turned in.
Each "new" share was accompanied by two Common Stock Purchase Warrants;  a Class
A Warrant exercisable within fifteen months and entitling the holder to purchase
one  additional  "new" share of the  Registrant's  Common Stock at $2.50;  and a
Class B Warrant  exercisable  at any time within thirty months and entitling the
holder to purchase one additional "new" share of the  Registrant's  Common Stock
at $3.50 a share.  A unit  consists  of one  Common  Stock  certificate  and two
Warrant certificates. Stockholders will be required to pay a transfer fee to the
transfer agent.


The  condition  of the  above-mentioned  re-issuance  was that all shares in the
stockholders'  possession,  or in the possession of the shareholder's broker, be
returned to the Registrant's  then transfer agent,  Liberty Transfer Co., by the
cut-off  date which was set at November  15, 1990,  5:00 p.m.  Eastern  Standard
Time.  Failure to comply with this provision would result in the cancellation of
any shares theretofore owned by stockholders.

On November 12, 1990, the Registrant  prepared and forwarded to all stockholders
of  record a notice  advising  the  stockholders  that  the  expiration  date to
surrender and exchange their Common Stock certificates had been extended to 5:00
p.m. on Monday,  December 31, 1990. On January 20, 1992,  due to the  bankruptcy
proceedings  and the  Registrant's  slow  restart-up,  the  Board  of  Directors
extended the Class A warrants another six months to June 30, 1993.

As part of the Registrant's Plan of  Reorganization,  as confirmed by the United
States  Bankruptcy  Court for the Eastern District of New York on April 30, 1990
and  consummated on June 2, 1992, the Registrant  issued an aggregate of 905,262
Series A Common  Stock  Purchase  Warrants  (the  "Series  A  Warrants")  and an
aggregate of 905,262  Series B Common  Stock  Purchase  Warrants  (the "Series B
Warrants").  The Series A Warrants  were  exercisable  at $2.50 per share within
fifteen (15) months from June 2, 1992,  the payment date under the Plan, or such
further  extension  as the  Registrant  may grant.  The  Series B Warrants  were
exercisable  at $3.50 per share within thirty months from the payment date under
the Plan, or such further extension as the Registrant may grant.




<PAGE>



The  jurisdiction  of the  Bankruptcy  Court over the affairs of the  Registrant
ended  on  June  2,  1992  when  the  Bankruptcy  Court  entered  the  order  of
consummation.  Due principally to the longer than anticipated  commencement date
of  operations  and with a view  towards  granting to  stockholders  the benefit
intended in the Plan,  management  determined that the six months  extension for
the  warrants  would be  inadequate.  Accordingly,  the Board of  Directors,  on
several occasions, has extended the warrants to December 31, 2000.

On February 25, 1993, The Company entered an agreement with Michaels Associates,
a  non-affiliated  business  entity,  and acquired an 85.81% equity  interest in
Netherland  Gardens  Owners,  Inc.  (NGO), a New York  corporation.  NGO was the
record and  beneficial  owner of a 59-unit co-op  residential  dwelling in White
Plains, New York (the "Co-op").

On January 11, 1996, the Company  entered a divestiture  agreement with Michaels
Associates.  In accordance with the agreement, the Company received back 450,000
shares that it had issued for the  acquisition of NGO and returned the shares of
NGO and the Co-op to Michaels Associates.

From 1996 to present, the Company has been investigating the opportunities for a
business  combination  with a profitable  privately  owned  entity.  The Company
believes its status as a public firm provides incentives for a merger to private
companies that seek access to capital markets.


ITEM 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY

(a)(1) Rental Premises.  Because the Company has been dormant since 1997, it has
used its Chairman`s  office address to receive mail. The Company had no activity
and did not pay any rent in the year ended April 30, 2000.

(a)(2) Inventory. In 1997, management determined that the inventory was obsolete
and worthless and decided to abandon it.


ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Since  the  consummation  of the  Plan of  Reorganization  on June 2,  1992,  no
material legal proceeding was pending or threatened  against, or settled by, the
Registrant.


ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

Neither during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended April 30, 2000 nor at
any time since August 15, 1994, did the Registrant  conduct an Annual Meeting of
its  stockholders  pursuant to definitive  proxy materials under Regulation 14 A
under the Act, or otherwise.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR COMMON STOCK EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

(a) Market Information.

The principal market for the Registrant's Common Stock, its only class of equity
securities, is the over-the-counter market.

The following  table  indicates  the quarterly  high and low price ranges of the
Registrant's  Common stock  representing  actual trades in the  over-the-counter
market  during the fiscal  years  ended April 30,  1999 and April 30,  2000,  as
reported by the Trading and Market Service of the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.

(b) Holders.

As of August 23, 2000, the approximate  number of holders of record of shares of
the Registrant's Common Stock,$.01 par value per share and Series A and Series B
Warrants,  the Registrant's  only class of trading  securities,  was believed by
management to be as follows:


<PAGE>



Title of Class                          Number of Record Holders


Common Stock, $.01 par                              325
Series A Warrant                                    285
Series B Warrant                                    286

Management  believes  there are many  shareholders  and  warrant  holders  whose
securities  are held in street name with  various  brokerage  houses.  The exact
number of shareholders is unknown to the Registrant.

(c) Dividends.

The  Registrant  has paid no  dividends  during the fiscal years ended April 30,
1999 and April 30, 2000.  Other than the requirements of the New Jersey Business
Corporation  Act that dividends be paid out of capital surplus only and that the
declaration and payment of a dividend not render The Registrant insolvent, there
are no  restrictions  on the  Registrant's  present  or  future  ability  to pay
dividends.

The payment by the  Registrant of dividends,  if any, in the future rests within
the  discretion of its Board of Directors  and will depend,  among other things,
upon the  Registrant's  earnings,  its capital  requirements,  and its financial
conditions, as well as other relevant factors.


ITEM 6. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION

The Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995  contains  "safe harbor"
provisions   regarding   forward-looking   statements.   Except  for  historical
information contained herein, the matters discussed in the Liquidity and Capital
Resources  section below contain potential risks and  uncertainties,  including,
without  limitation,  risks  related to the  Company's  ability to  successfully
identify  potential  merger  partners,  retain  key  employees  and  settle  any
outstanding debts. The Company will need to attract partners in order to execute
its revised  business  strategy,  and there can be no assurance that the Company
will be successful in attracting such partners.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In the fiscal years ended April 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company had  discontinued
all operations and did not earn any revenues.

In 2000 and 1999, the Company's general and administrative  expenses were due to
the Company's  President,  Joseph  Petito,  allowing the Company to operate on a
rent-free  basis in the premises of a privately  owned entity  controlled by Mr.
Petito's family.

The  Company  did not  conduct  any  research  and  development  or selling  and
marketing  activities  in the fiscal  years ended  April 30, 2000 and 1999.  The
Company is not currently  conducting any research and development or selling and
marketing activities.

During the fiscal  years ended April 30, 2000 and 1999 the Company  recognized a
net loss of $400 for each  year.  The net loss was  principally  the  result  of
accrued franchise tax. The amount of general and administrative expenses in 2000
was only $400.  Because of collection  time-limitations  provided in the federal
tax laws,  prior periods payroll taxes are no longer a liability of the Company.
The  Company  does  not  anticipate  sales of any  products  or  service  in the
foreseeable future other than those of a potential merger partner.


<PAGE>


The  drastic  reduction  in both the  Company's  gross  revenue  and general and
administrative  expenses was entirely  attributable to the Company's January 11,
1996  divestiture  of NGO. The  divestiture  left the Company  without  material
assets or capital  resources.  Accordingly,  the continued economic viability of
the Company is entirely  dependent  upon: (1) Mr.  Petito's  continued  funding,
assumption  of the  Company's  expenses,  providing  the Company with  rent-free
premises, and allowing the use of office equipment and (2) Orion's merger with a
profitable operating company.

There can be no assurance  whatsoever  that  management  will be  successful  in
consummating a business combination during the foreseeable future.  However, and
in spite of management's recent unsuccessful endeavors in attracting potentially
acceptable  business  combination  partners,   management  is  still  reasonably
optimistic that it can reach a preliminary  meeting of the minds with a business
combination partner prior to the end of the 2000 calendar year.


Financial Condition

In 1997, the Company  changed its direction from  investment in real estate to
finding a merger partner.

The Company did not have any cash, as of April 30, 2000 and 1999.  The Company's
current  assets  were $0,  on April  30,  1999 to April 30,  2000.  The  current
liabilities  increased  by $400 from  $129,812  on April 30, 1999 to $130,212 on
April 30, 2000.  The reason for the increase was the  additional  franchise  tax
accrued.  The  liability of $123,862 to the  Company's  shareholder  and officer
accounted for  approximately  96% of the current  liabilities  of the Company on
April 30, 2000 and 1999.

The Company is authorized to issue up to 10,000,000  shares of its Common Stock.
As of April  30,2000  and 1999,  there were  1,847,397  shares of the  Company's
Common Stock issued and  outstanding.  The Company issued -0- shares in 2000 and
1999.


Capital Expenditures

The Company did not have any material  commitments  for capital  expenditures at
April 30, 2000 and 1999.

Effects of Inflation

The Company  believes that the  relatively  moderate rate of inflation  over the
past few  years has not had a  significant  impact  on the  Company's  financial
position or operating results.



ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Financial statements meeting the requirements of Item 310 of regulation S-B, for
the fiscal year ending April 30, 1999 were audited by Bloom and Company, CPA's.

ITEM  8.  CHANGES  IN AND  DISAGREEMENTS  WITH  ACCOUNTANTS  ON  ACCOUNTING  AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

Due to the death of Meyer Zimmerman,  former Certified  Public  Accountant,  the
Company has retained Bloom and Company, CPA's as their independent auditor.

(4) Business Experience

The  following  is a  brief  account  of the  experience  of each  director  and
executive officers of the Registrant:

JOSEPH PETITO, Mr. Petito has been continually  employed by the Registrant since
1986. From 1983 to 1986, Mr. Petito was the  Registrant's  Chairman of the Board
of  Directors  and since 1986 has served as its  President  and Chief  Executive
Officer.  Simultaneously  therewith,  Mr. Petito had been the  President,  and a
principal   shareholder  of  Aardvark   Sanitation  Co.,  Inc.,  an  independent
industrial waste removal hauler located in Islip, New York, since that company's
inception in 1973.  Simultaneously,  and since its inception in 1979, Mr. Petito
had served as Secretary, Treasurer, Director and principal shareholder of Island
Salvage Haulers, Inc., an independent industrial waste removal concern in Garden
City,  New York.  During  the past ten  years,  Mr.  Petito has also acted as an

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors
Orion Diversified Technologies, Inc.
Garden City, New York

We  have  audited  the   accompanying   balance  sheets  of  Orion   Diversified
Technologies,  Inc. as of April 30, 2000 and 1999 and the related  statements of
operations,  changes in stockholders'  equity, and cash flows for the years then
ended.  These  financial  statements  are the  responsibility  of the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits.  The financial  statements of Orion  Diversified
Technologies, Inc. as of April 30, 1997, were audited by other auditors who have
ceased  operations  and whose report  dated  September  25,  1997,  expressed an
unqualified opinion on those statements.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting  principles  used, and  significant  estimates made, by
management as well as evaluating the overall financial  statement  presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Orion Diversified Technologies,
Inc. as of April 30, 2000 and 1999 and the results of its operation,  changes in
stockholders'  equity and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been  prepared  assuming that the
company  will  continue  as a  going  concern.  As  discussed  in  Note 7 to the
financial  statements,  the Company has  incurred  losses  from  operations  for
several  years and has a net capital  deficiency  that raise  substantial  doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans with regard
to these matters are also  described in Note 7. The financial  statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Orion   Diversified   Technologies,   Inc.  (the  Company),   d/b/a   Electronic
Transistors,  Corp.,  was  incorporated  in New Jersey in 1959.  The Company was
initially  engaged in the  marketing and sale of a line of  approximately  2,500
electronic semi-conductors,  principally transistors, diodes and rectifiers and,
to a lesser extent,  other ancillary related  electronics.  Because of sustained
operating  loses,  the Company  discontinued  this line of operation and filed a
plan of  reorganization  (under  Chapter 11) with the United  States  Bankruptcy
Court for the Eastern District of New York, on April 30, 1990.

Pursuant to the plan of reorganization,  the Company issued 905,262 unrestricted
shares  and an equal  number  of  Series A and  Series B Common  Stock  Purchase
Warrants to various creditors.  Under the plan,  creditors received one share of
common  stock,  a Series A warrant,  and a Series B warrant  for every  $5.00 of
debt.  The Series A and B warrants were  exercisable  at $2.50 and $3.50 and had
initial  expiration  dates of 15 and 20 months from June 2, 1992,  respectively.
The Company had the option to grant, and has continually  granted  extensions of
the exercise period of the warrants.

On  February  25,  1993,  the  Company  acquired  an 85.81%  equity  interest in
Netherland  Gardens  Owners,   Inc.  (a  New  York  corporation)  from  Michaels
Associates,  a non-affiliated  business entity.  The corporation owned a 59 unit
cooperative  residential  dwelling in White Plains, New York (the "Co-op").  The
Company  exchanged  500,000  shares of  restricted  stock for all shares held by
Michael Associates and issued 50,000 shares to the finder and broker.

From 1993 to 1996,  the Company's  investment in the Co-Op resulted in recurring
losses.  On January 11,  1996,  the Company  entered into a new  agreement  with
Michael  Associates.  Under  the new  agreement,  Michaels  Associates  retained
100,000 shares of the Company's stock,  cancelled the acquisition contract,  and
released the Company from any and all obligations.

Since 1996,  the Company has sought a merger  partner who will  benefit from the
Company's  access to capital  markets and provide  the Company  with  profitable
operations.

NOTE 2. - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES


Estimates and Assumptions

The  preparation  of financial  statements,  in  conformity  with the  generally
accepted  accounting  principles,  requires  management  to make  estimates  and
assumptions  that  affect the  reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents

The Company  considers  all highly  liquid  investments  with  maturity of three
months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.

Inventories

The Company's inventory of semi-conductors was composed of unsold obsolete items
with no market  value.  As of July 31, 1997,  the Company  wrote off $104,101 of
abandoned inventory.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line  method over the  estimated  useful  lives of the  related  assets
ranging  from  three to five  years.  Property  held  under  capital  leases  is
amortized over the lesser of the lease term or their estimated useful lives.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 2. - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES (continued)

Long-Lived Assets

The Company  follows the  provisions  of the  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  ("SFAS") No. 121 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets
and for Long-Lived  Assets to be disposed of". SFAS 121  establishes  accounting
standards  for the  impairment  of  long-lived  assets and certain  identifiable
intangibles  to  be  held  and  used  and  for  long-lived  assets  and  certain
identifiable intangibles to be disposed of.

The Company  reviews the  carrying  values of its  long-lived  and  identifiable
intangible  assets  for  possible  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of the  assets  may not be
recoverable.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and  liability  method.  Deferred
tax  assets  and  liabilities   are  recognized  for  future  tax   consequences
attributable to differences  between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing  assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit  carry-forwards.  Deferred  tax assets and  liabilities  are
measured  using  enacted tax rates  expected  to apply to taxable  income in the
years in which those  temporary  differences  are  expected to be  recovered  or
settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and  liabilities  of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


Non-monetary Transactions

The accounting for non-monetary assets is based on the fair values of the assets
involved.  Cost  of a  non-monetary  asset  acquired  in  exchange  for  another
non-monetary  asset is  recorded at the fair value of the asset  surrendered  to
obtain it. The difference in the costs of the assets  exchanged is recognized as
a gain or loss. The fair value of the asset received is used to measure the cost
if it is more clearly evident than the fair value of asset surrendered.

NOTE 2. - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES (continued)

Stock-Based Compensation

The  Company  has  adopted  Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion  25  for  its
accounting for stock based compensation. Under this policy:

1. Compensation costs are recognized as an expense over the period of employment
attributable to the employee stock options.

2. Stocks  issued in  accordance  with a plan for past or future  services of an
employee are allocated between the expired costs and future costs.  Future costs
are charged to the periods in which the  services are  performed.  The pro forma
amounts of the difference between  compensation cost, included in net income and
related cost,  measured by the fair value based method including the related tax
effects, are disclosed.

Earnings per Share

The Company  follows the  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 128,
Earnings Per Share ("SFAS No. 128").  SFAS No. 128 requires the  presentation of
both basic and diluted earnings per share.

New Accounting Standards

In June  1997,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  SFAS  130,
"Reporting  Comprehensive  Income". SFAS 130 establishes standards for reporting
and display of  comprehensive  income and its  components  (revenues,  expenses,
gains,  and  losses)  in a full set of  general  purpose  financial  statements.
Specifically,  SFAS 130  requires  that all items  that meet the  definition  of
components of comprehensive  income be reported in a financial statement for the
period in which they are recognized.  However, SFAS 130 does not specify when to
recognize,  or how to measure, the items that make up comprehensive income. SFAS
130 is effective for fiscal years  beginning  after December 15, 1997, and early
application is permitted.  Management  believes the application of SFAS 130 will
not have a material effect on the Company's future financial statements.

In June  1997,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  SFAS  131,
"Financial  Reporting for Segments of Business  Enterprise." SFAS 131 supersedes
the "industry  segment" concept of SFAS 14 with a "management  approach" concept
as the basis for  identifying  reportable  segments.  SFAS 131 is effective  for
fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  15,  1997 and  early  application  is
permitted.  Management  believes  the  application  of SFAS  131 will not have a
material effect on the Company's future financial statements.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 2. - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES (continued)

New Accounting Standards

In April  1998,  the FASB issued SOP 98-5,  "Reporting  on the Costs of Start-up
Activities,"  which will become  effective  for the Company in fiscal  2000.  It
requires costs of start-up  activities and organization costs to be expressed as
incurred.  The Company  currently follows this approach and such costs have been
minimal in the past.

In February 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132,  "Employers'  Disclosures  About
Pensions and Other  Post-retirement  Benefits,"  which became  effective for the
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. The statement  standardizes  the
disclosure requirements for pension plans and other post retirement benefits. To
the extent practicable, the statement requires additional information on changes
in the benefit  obligations  and fair value of plan assets.  The Company adopted
the SFAS 132. The adoption of SFAS No. 132 did not have  material  impact on the
Company's consolidated financial statements,  the results of operations,  or the
notes thereto.


NOTE 3 - PAYROLL TAXES

In connection with the Plan of Reorganization, payroll taxes were due within six
years from April 23, 1986, the date of assessment.  The Company has not paid the
$137,465  tax  liability  and the  taxing  authorities  have  taken no action to
collect it.  Management  believes that,  under the current federal and state tax
laws,  the liability is subject to the statute of limitation and therefore is no
longer due.


NOTE 4 - COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS

In accordance with the Plan of  Reorganization,  905,262  redeemable Class A and
Class B Purchase  Warrants were issued between  September 19, 1990, and December
30, 1990.  Each  warrant  entitles the holder to purchase one "new" share of the
Company's  stock for each warrant that is exercised.  The exercise  price of the
Class A and Class B  Warrants  are $2.50 and $3.50,  respectively.  The Board of
Directors  of the Company  extended  the  expiration  dates for both  Classes of
Warrants to December 31, 2000.

As of August  15,  2000,  903,762  Class A and  905,262  Class B  Warrants  were
outstanding.


NOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Transactions with Management

The Company has agreed to certain transactions with Joseph Petito, the Company's
President,   Chief  Operating  Officer,  Chairman  of  the  Board  and  majority
shareholder. Such transactions are described below:

1. Facilities

The  Company's  President  has  arranged for the Company to conduct its business
affairs on the premises of a company  controlled by the President and located in
Ronkonkoma, New York. Said premises and office equipment are being utilized on a
rent-free basis.

Transactions with Management


2. Compensation and Other Costs

The  Company  has had no sales or  other  income  since  the  relocation  of its
offices.  As a result,  Mr.  Petito has advanced  virtually all of the Company's
operating expenses.

On June 2, 1990, the Board of Directors  agreed to provide  compensation  to Mr.
Petito,  at the rate of $1,500 per week.  On May 2, 1994,  Mr.  Petito agreed to
forego the $1,500  weekly  compensation  until the Company  shows a  significant
upward trend in its results of operations.


3. Due to Officer

As of April 30, 2000, the amounts owed to the officer were as follows

NOTE 6. INCOME TAXES (Continued)

Management  believes  that there is a risk that certain of these NOLs may expire
unused and, accordingly, has established a valuation allowance against them.

The valuation allowance of $10,562 as of April 30, 1999 was reduced by $4,831 as
a consequence of recognizing tax benefit of loss carryforward, in 2000.

Income tax expense  differed from the amount  computed by applying the statutory
U.S.  Federal  Income Tax rates of 15% to the taxable  incomes  before  taxes of
1998:

NOTE 7. GOING CONCERN BASIS AND FUTURE PLANS

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going

liabilities in the normal course of business.

Orion has not realized any material revenues for the three years ended April 30,
1997,  and the  consolidated  results of operations for the year ended April 30,
1998 reflect a loss of $151,618.  The Company also is entirely  supported by its
majority shareholder.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern.

Management's  long-standing  plans to remedy these conditions involve a business
combination with a profitable  private company in a reverse merger  transaction.
The Company further anticipates an eventual improvement in liquidity through the
exercise of the Company's Class A and B Warrants.
