ITEM  1.  BUSINESS
- ------------------

Tri-Valley Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is in the business of exploring,
acquiring and developing prospective and producing petroleum and precious metals
properties and interests therein.  Tri-Valley has two wholly owned subsidiaries.
Tri-Valley  Oil  & Gas Company ("TVOG") operates the oil & gas activities.  TVOG
derives  the  majority  of  its  revenue  from gas production.  Tri-Valley Power
Corporation  is  the other wholly owned subsidiary.  However, this subsidiary is
inactive at the present time.  The precious metals activity is operated directly
by  Tri-Valley  Corporation.

TVOG  primarily  generates  its  own  exploration  prospects  from  its internal
database,  and  also  screens  prospect  submittals  from  other  geologists and
companies.  TVOG  generates these geological "plays" within a certain geographic
area  of  mutual  interest ("AMI").  The prospect is then presented to potential
co-venturers.  The  company  deals  with both sophisticated individual investors
and  energy  industry  companies.  TVOG  is  the  operator of these co-ventures.

In  1987, the Company acquired precious metals claims on Alaska state lands. The
Company has conducted exploration operations on these properties and has reduced
its  original  claims  to  a  block  of  approximately 38,760 acres (60.6 square
miles).  The  Company  has conducted trenching, core drilling, bulk sampling and
assaying activities to date and has reason to believe that mineralization exists
to justify additional exploration and development activities.  However, to date,
the  Company  has  not  identified probable mineral reserves on these properties


ITEM  2.  PROPERTIES
- --------------------

The  Company's  headquarters and administrative offices are located at 230 South
Montclair  Street, Suite 101, Bakersfield, California 93309.  The Company leases
approximately 2,500 square feet of office space at that location.  The principal
properties  of  the  Company  consist  of  proven  and  unproven oil and gas and
precious  metal properties, maps and geologic records related to prospective oil
and  gas  and precious metal properties, office and other equipment.  TVOG has a
worldwide  geologic  library  with  data  on  every  continent except Antarctica
including over 700 leads and prospects in California, the Company's present area
of  emphasis.  This is further supported by a database of over 20,000 line miles
of  2-D  seismic.

Oil  and  Gas  Operations
- -------------------------

The  oil  and  gas properties in which the Company holds interests are primarily
located  in  the area of central California known as the Sacramento Valley.  The
Company  also  leases  exploration  acreage  in  the San Joaquin and Santa Maria
Valleys.  The  Company  contracts for the drilling of all its wells and does not
own any drilling equipment, bulk storage facilities, transportation pipelines or
refineries.

The  company  has  retained  the  services  of Cecil Engineering, an independent
engineer,  for  the  purposes  of  estimating  the Company's net share of proved
developed  oil  and  gas reserves on all the Company's oil and gas properties at
December  31,  2000.  The  Company  does not include any undeveloped reserves in
these  reserve  studies  and,  accordingly,  only  proved developed reserves are
reported  herein.  Price  is  a  material  factor  in the stated reserves of the
Company,  because  higher  prices  permit  relatively higher-cost reserves to be
produced  economically.  Higher  prices  generally permit longer recovery, hence
larger  reserves  at  higher  values.  Conversely,  lower prices generally limit
recovery  to  lower-cost  reserves,  hence  smaller  reserves.  The  process  of
estimating  oil  and  gas reserve quantities is inherently imprecise.  Ascribing
monetary values to those reserves, therefore, yields imprecise estimated data at
best.

The  estimated future net recoverable oil and gas reserves from proved developed
properties as of December 31, 2000, December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998 were
as  follows:

                                               ---                       -----

December  31,  1998             Condensate     234     Natural Gas     1,434,539

Using  year-end  oil  and  gas  prices  and  current  levels  of lease operating
expenses,  the  estimated  present value of the future net revenue to be derived
from the Company's proved developed oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10%, was
$12,920,069 at December 31, 2000, $1,308,178 at December 31, 1999,and $1,213,400
at  December  31,  1998.  Reference  is  made  to  the  unaudited  supplemental
information  of the consolidated financial statements for further information on
oil  and  gas  reserves  and  estimated  values.

The  following  table sets forth the net quantities of natural gas and crude oil
produced  by  Registrant  during:

As of December 31, 2000, the Company had the following gross and net position in
wells  and  developed  acreage:

          Wells  (1)                                     Acres (2)
          ----------                                   ----------

(1)     "Gross" wells represent the total number of producing wells in which the
Company  has  a  working  interest.  "Net"  wells  represent the number of gross
producing  wells  multiplied by the percentages of the working interests therein
by  the  Company.  "Net  wells" recognizes only those wells in which the Company
holds  an  earned working interest.  Working interests earned at payout have not
been  included.

(2)     "Gross"  acres  represent  the  total  acres  in which the Company has a
working  interest;  "net" acres represent the aggregate of the working interests
of  the  Company  in  the  gross  acres.

The  Company drilled one exploratory well in 2000, but as of March 15, 2001, the
Company  has  not  determined  whether  this  well  is  capable  of  commercial
production.  See  Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition -
Petroleum  Activities,  page  8.

*At  December  31,  2000  ,  one well, the Ekho #1, had been drilled but not yet
completed.  The  Sunrise  Mayel  #1  was  still  drilling.

**During  2000  we  plugged and abandoned one well that had been drilled in 1998
but  had  never  produced  hydrocarbons  in  commercial  quantities.

The  following  table  sets  forth information regarding undeveloped oil and gas
acreage  in  which  the  Company  had  an  interest  on  December  31,  2000.

                  State          Gross Acres          Net Acres
                  -----          -----------          ---------
                California         25,564              20,890
                  Nevada           14,575              14,575

Some  of  the  Company's  undeveloped  acreage  is  held pursuant to leases from
landowners.  Such  leases  have  varying dates of execution and generally expire
one  to  five  years  after  the  date  of  the  lease.

Precious  Metals
- ----------------

The  precious  metals  properties  are  located  in  interior  Alaska.  They are
comprised  of  898 40-acre claims and 16 160-acre prospecting sites, of which 84
claims  are  leased  from  others,  located solely on State open lands requiring
annual  assessment  work,  and  an  annual per claim fee.  All fees are current.

The  following  table  sets forth the information regarding the acreage position
the  Company  has  under  lease  in  Alaska  as  of  December  31,  2000:

                  State          Gross Acres          Net Acres
                  -----          -----------          ---------
                  Alaska           38,760              37,966

Mineral  properties claimed on Open State land require minimum annual assessment
work  of  $100  worth per State of Alaska claim.  In 1999, the Company staked 40
160-acre  prospecting sites.  In July 2000, the Company converted 24 prospecting
sites  into  96  new claims and staked an additional 32 claims to bring its land
position  to  approximately  40,640 acres (63.5 square miles).  These additional
128  claims  were  subsequently dropped in November 2000.  Also in 2000, Kinross
Gold  Co.,  successor  to  Cyprus  Amax  Mining  Co.,  quitclaimed  81 claims to
Tri-Valley,  bringing  its  present  land position to approximately 38,760 acres
(60.6  square  miles).  Expenditures  on  the  Richardson,  Alaska  acreage have
already  carried  forward annual assessment requirements more than four years on
all  its  claims.  The  Company  has  no  Federal  claims.


ITEM  2.  PROPERTIES
- --------------------

Tri-Valley  has  had  a  joint  scientific  research agreement with TsNIGRI, the
Central  Research  Institute  of  Geological  Prospecting  for Base and Precious
Metals, based in Moscow, Russia since 1991.  The proprietary technology they use
for evaluating large areas of covered sub-arctic terrain has been impressive and
encouraging  to our efforts.  Physical gold has been found at 60 locations along
a  20-mile  swath  and  over  1,000 samples have been assayed by Bondar-Clegg, a
respected  assay  house.  We  believe  we  have  a great potential and intend to
continue  our  exploration  and  future  development  of  these  properties.

Management  believes  it  has demonstrated that the Company possesses a superior
mineral property which could reward the shareholders dramatically from discovery
success  with  little  downside  exposure  at  present.

Environmental
- -------------

The  Company's energy operations are subject to a number of regulations relating
to  environmental  protection,  as are all exploration and production companies.
However,  the  Company  believes it is in full compliance with all environmental
related  rules  and  regulations.


ITEM  3.  LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS
- ----------------------------

During 2000, we settled one lawsuit between the Company and a former consultant,
which had been pending from 1997.  We were not party to any other material legal
proceedings  during  2000.


ITEM  4.  SUBMISSION  OF  MATTERS  TO  A  VOTE  OF  SECURITY  HOLDERS
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

On  September  16,  2000,  the  Company  held  its  annual meeting.  The matters
submitted  to a vote of the security holders included the election of directors,
restated  Certificate  of  Incorporation , and the election by the Company to be
governed  by  203  of  the  Delaware General Corporation Laws.  The shareholders
elected  all  of  the  nominees  for director who were recommended by the board.
They  approved  the  restated  Certificate  of  Incorporation  and  approved the

As of December 31, 2000, the Company estimates that its common stock was held by
approximately  2,000  shareholders of record in 40 states and at least 4 foreign
countries.

The  Company  historically has paid no dividends, and at this time does not plan
to  pay  any  dividends in the immediate future.  Rather, the Company strives to
add  share  value  through discovery success.  As of January 22, 2001, we had 13
market  makers  for  our  stock.  In  2000,  trading  volume exceeded 14 million
shares.

Recent  Sales  of  unregistered  Securities

Notice  Regarding  Forward-Looking  Statements

This  report  contains  forward-looking  statements.  The  words,  "anticipate,"
"believe,"  "expect,"  "plan,"  "intend," "estimate," "project," "could," "may,"
"foresee,"  and  similar  expressions  are  intended to identify forward-looking
statements.  These statements include information regarding expected development
of  the Company's business, lending activities, relationship with customers, and
development  in  the oil and gas industry.  Should one or more of these risks or
uncertainties  occur,  or  should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual
results  may  vary  materially  and  adversely from those anticipated, believed,
estimated  or  otherwise  indicated.

Overview

We  believe  that,  after  20  years  of  downsizing  in the petroleum industry,
increased  oil  and  natural  gas  prices  during  the  past year have created a
favorable  environment  for  renewed  growth.  Production from existing reserves
continues  to  decline,  while  demand increases.  While the trend for demand to
outstrip  available  supplies  is
worldwide  as  well  as  national,  we  believe that it is particularly acute in
California,  our primary venue for exploration and production, which imports 53%
of  its  oil  and  85%  of its natural gas demand.  According to Liam McGee, the
President  of  Bank of America, California is the world's fifth largest economy.
Oil  prices tend to be set based on worldwide supplies and prices, while natural
gas  prices  seem to be more dependent on local conditions.  Over the past year,
natural gas prices in California have risen dramatically, and our revenue due to
oil  and  gas  sales has risen with the price of gas.  We expect that gas prices
will  hold steady or possibly increase over the next year.  If has prices should
fall,  for  instance  due to new regulatory measures or the discovery of new and
easily  producible reserves, our revenue from oil and gas sales would also fall.

We  are  now  grading and prioritizing our geologic library, which contains over
700 leads and prospects, for exploratory drilling.  We use our library to decide
where  we should seek oil and gas leases for future explorations.  Of course, we
cannot  be  sure that any future prospect can be obtained at an attractive lease
price  or that any exploration efforts would result in a commercially successful
well.

Already  the  first  two  prospects,  Ekho  #1  and  the  Sunrise Mayel #1, have
discovered  resources  of  accumulations of exceptional potentials in the mapped
area,  according  to  logs  and  cores of the test wells recently drilled.  Both
wells  are  in "tight" reservoirs and require artificial hydraulic fracturing to
enhance  flow rates and neither can yet be certified as commercial, so we cannot
be  sure  that  either  of  these  prospects  will  result  in proved, developed
reserves.  In each play, Tri-Valley has as many as 40 or more locations based on
spacing  rules,  in  its  lease  blocks  over  mapped  closures.

Management  is  confident  that  the  Company inventory and projects can deliver
exceptional  value  to  shareholders  and  partners if we can fund a velocity of
drilling  to  make  the  discoveries  among  the  inevitable  dry  holes  of the
exploration  businessWe  seek  to  fund  and drill enough exploratory wells for
commercial  discoveries to make up for the cost of the inevitable dry holes that
we  can  expect, in the exploration business.  Our future results will depend on
our  success in finding new reserves and commercial production, and there can be
no  assurance  what  revenue  we can ultimately expect from any new discoveries.

Natural  Gas  Activities

The Company generally sells a percentage of production on a fixed contract price
and  the remainder at the monthly spot price.  In times when we expect the price
of  gas  to  weaken,  we  try to increase the amount we sell under fixed prices.
When  we  expect  the price of gas to rise, we seek to sell more gas in the spot
market.  In  2000, we sold 49% of our production under fixed price contracts and
51%  on  the  spot market.  Because we expect gas prices to continue to rise, we
intend  to  sell  100% of our production on the spot market in 2001.  Because we
plan  to  sell only on the spot market in 2001, a drop in the price of gas would
have  a  more  adverse  impact  on  us  than if we entered into some fixed price
contracts  for  sale  of  future  production.




ITEM  6.  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION

Our  hydrocarbon  reserves were valued by independent engineers at a net present
value  of  $11,887,320  at  December
31,  2000,  an  increase of $10,670,021 from December 31, 1999 after taking into
account  the  SEC mandatory 10% discount rate and also taking into consideration
the effect of income tax.  This was due primarily to the increase in gas prices.
This value does not appear on the balance sheet because accounting rules require
discovered  reserves to be carried on the balance sheet at the cost of obtaining
them  rather  than  the  actual  future  net  revenue  from  producing  them.

Tri-Valley  arranges  to be carried, (we don't have to pay for our interest), in
the  test wells on prospects.  Under these arrangements, we usually minimize the
Company's  cost  to  drill  and  also  receive  relatively little value from the
reserves  we  discover.  On the other hand, we occasionally incur extra expenses
for drilling or development that we choose, in our discretion, not to pass on to
other  venture  participants.  This  occurred in 2000, when we incurred dry hole
expenses  of  $440,228  that  we  elected  not  to  charge  to our co-venturers.

Petroleum  Activities

We  began  drilling  the  Ekho  No. 1 on February 7, 2000.  This is the first of
three  test  wells  in  a program to test deep mapped structure approximately 26
miles  long  and  four  to  five  miles  wide  and  north  of Bakersfield, where
Tri-Valley  Oil  and  Gas (TVOG) is headquartered.  The Ekho No. 1 reached total
depth  of 19,085 feet in record time, taking only 80 drilling days.  We hoped to
drill  into  naturally  fractured  area  of  the  target  formation  to  achieve
natural flow potential.  The well did encounter oil that is 48.6 API gravity and
1,460  Btu  gas  with  no  H2S,  CO2,  nitrogen or water.  However, the borehole
encountered  "tight"sands,  which  will require artificial fracturing to provide
avenues  for  the  oil  and  gas  to  flow  at  higher  rates.

This  additional  cost  came  at  a time when the Canadian partners in the joint
venture  encountered national market conditions that precluded them from raising
sufficient funds to stay in the project and all but one of the Canadian partners
dropped  out.  Tri-Valley  is  in  the  process of repartnering the project with
stronger  partners  to assure that the project can go forward through completion
of  the  Ekho  No.  1  and  into  drilling  the Ekho No. 2 and No. 3 test wells.

Precious  Metals  Activity

The  price  of  gold has fluctuated in the last 12 months from a high of $316.20
per  oz.  to  a  low  of  $262.80  per  oz.  However,  the  Company believes its
properties  contain deposits that can produce the gold at a cost that will still
allow  a  significant  profit.

Tri-Valley  and  Placer  Dome U.S., Inc., entered into an agreement on March 22,
1999,  whereby they would explore part of our claim block.  They performed field
exploration  work  in the summer of 1999 and 2000.  However due to the depressed
prices  of  gold,  Placer Dome on September 18, 2000, notified us that they were
not  going  to  go  further  on  the  agreement.  Tri-Valley  retains  rights to
60.6square  miles  of  claims  and  prospecting  sites.

We  are  confident  that  other  parties will be willing to participate when the
price  of  gold  recovers.  Kennecott  Exploration  has  signed  a
confidentiality/non-compete  agreement  on  Tri-Valley's entire claim block plus
another  50  square  miles  surrounding.

Telecommunications

We  loaned  a  general  partnership $125,000.00 in 1997 which was secured by the
assets  of the partnership.  The note is in default and the Company is trying to
collect  on  this  note.  The  managing  general  partner is alleging the assets
belong  to an L.L.C., which is in bankruptcy.  The underlying licenses are being
sold  and  the  proceeds  will  be  put  in  escrow  until  the bankruptcy court
determines  the  rightful owner.  We feel that we will prevail and be successful
in  recovering  our  claim.






ITEM  6.  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION

RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS

Comparison  of  Years  Ended  December  31,  2000  and  1999
- ------------------------------------------------------------

Balance  Sheet
- --------------

The  Company  had  $1,373,570  cash  on  hand  at  December 31, 2000 compared to
$8,050,469  at  December  31, 1999.  This decrease was the result of the Company
spending  funds  that  had  been advanced by our joint venture partners to drill
Ekho  #1.  Trade  accounts  receivable  are $663,177 (427% greater) for the year
ended  December  31,  2000  compared to the same period last year.  This was the
result  of  increased  production due to re-working of some of our wells and the
increase  of  natural  gas  prices.  Trade  accounts  payable were $189,913 (48%
greater)  in the year ended December 31, 2000 due to invoices to be paid related
to  drilling  the  Sunrise-Mayel#1  well.  Accounts  payable  to  joint  venture
participants  is  larger  this  year due to accrued revenue at year-end on their
behalf.  The  decrease in advances from joint venture participants is because at
year  end  1999  we had funds on deposit for the Ekho #1 that were paid out over
2000  as  the  well  was  drilled.

Revenues

Oil and Gas sales of $1,045,013 for the year ended 2000 compared to $522,591 for
the  year  ended  1999,  a  199%  increase.  This  $522,422  increase was due to
increased  production  and  the increase in natural gas prices.  The decrease of
$928,791  in  sale of oil and gas properties was because the prospect we sold in
2000  was  smaller  than  the  prospect  sold  in  1999.

Interest  income increased by $66,881 (207%) in 2000 to $99,234, from $32,353 in
1999.  The increased interest income came from funds the company had on account.

Other  income  dropped  to $34,862 in 2000 from $261,460 in 1999, because Placer
Dome  USA,  paid the Company $225,000 pursuant to our option agreement signed in
1999,  discussed  inPrecious  Metals  Activity.

Costs  and  Expenses
- --------------------

Costs  and  expenses  are  $900,287  greater  for  the  fiscal  year 2000, a 34%
increase.  The  oil and gas lease expenses were $440,428 larger due to the write
off  of  a  well  that  was  drilled  in  a  previous year.  Cost of oil and gas
prospects  sold  are  $276,051  (26%)  less  this year because this prospect was
smaller  than  the  one  sold  in 1999.  General and administrative expenses are
$928,847 (107%) greater due to legal costs and the settlement of a lawsuit filed
in  1997.

In  1999, we recorded $148,334 for impairment of  acquisition costs, as we wrote
down  the  value  of  previously  acquired  properties.  We  incurred  no  such
impairment  expense  in  2000.

Financial  Condition

Operating  Activities

Tri-Valley  had  a negative cash flow from operations during 2000.  This was due
in  large  part  to  a one-time charge to settle the lawsuit.  Also, the Company
incurred a write-off of a well deemed to be non-commercial.  The Company expects
to  have  a  positive  cash  flow  in  the fiscal year 2001 due to the increased
natural  gas  prices.

Investing  Activities

In 2000, we spent $293,489 on capital expenditures, compared to $105,713 in 1999
- -  a  177%  increase.  The capital expenditures were incurred in connection with
leasing  activities.  Our  proceeds  from  sale of property increased by $74,760
(93%)  in 2000 to $154,760, compared to $80,000 in 1999.  Overall, our cash used
by  investing  activities  rose  to  $155,782  in  2000  from $27,033 in 1999, a
$128,749  (476%)  increase.



ITEM  6.  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION

Financing  Activities

Cash  used by financing activities was ($5,111,663) in fiscal year 2000 compared
to  cash provided financing activities of $7,918,906 for fiscal year ended 1999.
In  1999,  joint  venture participants advanced $7,742,568 for the Ekho #1 well.
In  2000,  we recorded a decrease of funds advanced of $5,359,863 as we expended
the  funds  to  drill  the  well.

The Company in recent years has financed a portion of its operations by the sale
of  the  Company's  common stock in private placement transactions.  In 2000, we
raised $285,000 from private placements of common stock, compared to $171,307 in
1999.

The  overall  increase  in  all  activity related to our cash flows in 2000 were
directly  related  to  the  large size of the Ekho project, for which funds were
largely  raised  in  1999  and  spent  in  2000,  on  the  first  Ekho  well.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S


The  Board  of  Directors
Tri-Valley  Corporation
Bakersfield,  California


We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Tri-Valley
Corporation  as  of  December  31,  2000  and 1999, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the
years  then  ended.  These  financial  statements  are the responsibility of the
Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express an opinion on these
financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant estimates made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a  reasonable  basis  for  our opinion.

In  our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly in all material respects the financial position of Tri-Valley Corporation
at  December  31,  2000  and 1999, and the results of their operations and their
cash  flows  for  the  years  then  ended, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting  principles.

                             TRI-VALLEY CORPORATION
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                           DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999



NOTE  1  -  SUMMARY  OF  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES
            ----------------------------------------------

This  summary  of  significant  accounting policies of Tri-Valley Corporation is
presented  to  assist  in  understanding the Company's financial statements. The
financial  statements and notes are representations of the Company's management,
which  is  responsible  for  their  integrity and objectivity.  These accounting
policies  conform  to  generally  accepted  accounting  principles and have been
consistently  applied  in  the  preparation  of  the  financial  statements.

Principles  of  Consolidation
- -----------------------------

The  consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tri-Valley Oil & Gas Co.  All material intercompany
accounts  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated  in  consolidation.

Use  of  Estimates  in  the  Preparation  of  Financial  Statements
- -------------------------------------------------------------------

The  preparation  of  financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures at the date
of  the  financial  statements  as  well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses  during  the  reporting  period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Material  estimates  that  are  particularly  susceptible  to significant change
relate  to  the  estimate  of  Company  oil  and  gas  reserves  prepared  by an
independent  engineering  consultant.  Such  estimates  are  subject to numerous
uncertainties  inherent  in  the  estimation  of  quantities of proved reserves.
Estimated  reserves  are  used in the calculation of depletion, depreciation and
amortization  as  well  as  the  Company's  assessment  of  proved  oil  and gas
properties  for  impairment.

History  and  Business  Activity
- --------------------------------

Historically  an oil and gas exploration and production company, emphasizing the
Sacramento  Valley  natural  gas  province  and now very active in the south San
Joaquin  Valley.   In  1987,  the Company added precious metals exploration. The
Company conducts its oil and gas business primarily through its wholly owned oil
and  gas  subsidiary,  Tri-Valley Oil & Gas Company ("TVOG"). TVOG is engaged in
the  exploration,  acquisition  and  production  of oil and gas properties .  At
present,  the  precious  metals exploration activities are conducted directly by
the  parent,  Tri-Valley  Corporation  ("TVC").  TVC  has  traditionally  sought
acquisition  or merger opportunities within and outside of petroleum and mineral
industries.

Cash  Equivalent  and  Short-Term  Investments
- ----------------------------------------------
Cash  equivalents  include  cash  on hand and on deposit, and highly liquid debt
instruments  with  original  maturities  of  three  months  or  less.

Goodwill
- --------

The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  net  assets purchased of
Tri-Valley  Corporation's  wholly owned oil and gas subsidiary, TVOG. Net assets
are  carried  at  their fair market value at the acquisition date. The excess of
acquisition  costs over the fair value of assets acquired is included in and has
been  allocated  to  goodwill.  Goodwill  of  $433,853  is  being amortized on a
straight-line  basis over 40 years. The carrying amount of goodwill is evaluated
periodically.  Factors  used  in the evaluation include the Company's ability to
raise  capital as a public company and anticipated cash flows from operating and
non-operating  mineral properties. Tri-Valley Corporation has not established an
allowance  for  the  impairment  of  goodwill  which  may be realized should the
Company  be  acquired  or  merged  with  another  organization.

<PAGE>
NOTE  1  -  SUMMARY  OF  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (Continued)
            ----------------------------------------------

Acquisition  Costs
- ------------------

In  prior  years,  the  Company  capitalized  costs  as  a  part  of a potential
acquisition  of 26 wireless communication licenses held by five partnerships. As
discussed  in  Note  9,  the  licenses  and  equipment,  which  the  Company may
eventually  acquire,  are included in a security agreement as collateral between
the  debtor  and  the  Company.  During 1999, $148,334 of previously capitalized
acquisition  costs  were  considered  impaired.

Drilling  Agreements/Joint  Ventures
- ------------------------------------

Tri-Valley  frequently  participates  in  drilling agreements whereby it acts as
operator  of  drilling  and  producing  activities.  As  operator,  TVOG  is
contingently  liable  for  the activities of these ventures.  The Company owns a
carried  interest and/or overriding royalty interest in such ventures, earning a
working  interest  at  payout.

Receivables  from and amounts payable to these related parties (as well as other
related  parties) have been segregated in the accompanying financial statements.
In  the  event the Company has expended funds for a project in an amount greater
than  the  original  contribution  from  investors,  the  Company cash-calls the
participants  for  additional  funds. Excess project funding is held until it is
determined  that  no further requirement exists for abandonment or plugging back
of  project  wells,  at  which time the funds are refunded. In 2000, the Company
expensed  $490,861 worth of joint venture project costs attributed to a dry hole
project.

Sale  of  Oil  and  Gas  Prospects
- ----------------------------------

The  Company  sells  the  rights  to oil and gas prospects to the joint ventures
created  for  drilling  and  exploration activities. These amounts represent the
Company's costs of leasing and acquiring the prospects, and other geological and
geophysical  costs  (hereafter  referred  to  as  "GGLA")  plus  a profit to the
Company.  The  Company recognizes gain on the sale of prospect GGLA at the point
when  the  joint  venture  is  fully  funded, as the portion of the project cost
attributed  to  GGLA  is  nonrefundable  upon  completion  of  project  funding.

Oil  and  Gas  Property  and  Equipment  (Successful  Efforts)
- --------------------------------------------------------------

The  Company  accounts  for its oil and gas exploration and development costs on
the  successful  efforts  method.  Under  this  method, costs to acquire mineral
interests  in  oil  and  gas properties, to drill and complete exploratory wells
that  find  proved  reserves  and  to  drill  and complete development wells are
capitalized.  Exploratory  dry-hole  costs, geological and geophysical costs and
costs  of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed when incurred,
except  those  GGLA  expenditures  incurred  on behalf of joint venture drilling
projects,  which  the Company defers until the GGLA is sold at the completion of
project  funding.  Depletion,  depreciation  and  amortization  of  oil  and gas
producing  properties  are  computed  on  an  aggregate  basis  using  the
units-of-production  method.

The  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB),  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  (SFAS)  No.  121,  "Accounting  for  the  Impairment  of
Long-Lived  Assets  and/or  Long-Lived  Assets to be Disposed of," requires that
long-lived  assets  be  reviewed  for  impairment  whenever events or changes in
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  may  not be
recoverable.  It  establishes guidelines for determining recoverability based on
future  net  cash flows from the use of the asset and for the measurement of the
impairment  loss.  Impairment  loss  under  SFAS  No.  121  is calculated as the
difference  between  the  carrying  amount  of the asset and its fair value. Any
impairment  loss  is  recorded  in  the  current period in which the recognition
criteria  are  first  applied  and  met.  Under the successful efforts method of
accounting  for  oil  and  gas operations, the Company periodically assesses its
proved  properties  for impairments by comparing the aggregate net book carrying
amount  of all proved properties with their aggregate future net cash flows. The
statement  requires  that the impairment review be performed on the lowest level
of  asset  groupings for which there are identifiable cash flows. In the case of
the  Company,  this  results  in  a  field  by  field  impairment  review.

Upon  the  sale  of  oil  and  gas  reserves  in  place,  costs less accumulated
amortization  of  such property are removed from the accounts and resulting gain
or loss on sale is reflected in operations.  Upon abandonment of properties, the
reserves are deemed fully depleted and any unamortized costs are recorded in the
statement  of  operations  under  leases  sold,  relinquished  and  impaired.

NOTE  1  -  SUMMARY  OF  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (Continued)
            ----------------------------------------------

Gold  Mineral  Property
- -----------------------

The  Company  has  invested  in  several  gold  mineral properties with economic
development  potential.  All mineral claim acquisition costs and exploration and
development  expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. The Securities and
Exchange  Commission  permits  capitalization  of  acquisition,  exploration and
development  costs  only  after  persuasive  engineering evidence is obtained to
support  recoverability  of  these  costs  (ideally upon determination of proven
and/or  probable  reserves  based  upon  dense  drilling samples and feasibility
studies  by  a  recognized  independent  engineer).  Although  the  Company  has
performed  drilling  samples,  and  an  independent engineer has deemed the gold
properties contain profitable reserves, management has chosen to follow the more
conservative  method of accounting by expensing gold mineral costs in the period
the  expense  is  incurred.

Properties  and  Equipment
- --------------------------

Properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the
following  estimated  useful  lives:

          Office furniture and fixtures                3 - 7 years
          Building                                        40 years

Leasehold  improvements  are  amortized  over  the  life  of  the  lease.

Maintenance  and  repairs,  which  neither  materially  add  to the value of the
property  nor  appreciably prolong its life, are charged to expense as incurred.
Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment other than oil and gas
are  reflected  in  operations.

Concentration  of  Credit  Risk  and  Fair  Value  of  Financial  Instruments
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As  discussed  in  Note 6, the Company sells oil, gas and natural gas liquids to
primarily  one  purchaser  located  in  the  northern  California  region.

The  Company  places  its  temporary  cash  investments with high credit quality
financial  institutions  and  limits  the  amount  of credit exposure to any one
financial  institution.

Fair  value  of  financial  instruments are estimated to approximate the related
book value, unless otherwise indicated, based on market information available to
the  Company. The fair value of the Company's note receivable is estimated based
on  the  discounted  value of the future cash flows expected to be received, and
considers  the length of time the note has been in default. The present value is
estimated  to  be  $94,000  at  December  31,  2000.

Earnings  (Loss)  Per  Share  (SFAS  128)
- -----------------------------------------

Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (FASB), Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards  No.  128 (SFAS 128), "Earnings Per Share", was adopted by the Company
for  the  year  ended  December  31, 1997. SFAS 128 replaces the presentation of
primary earnings per share with a presentation of basic earnings per share based
upon  the  weighted  average  number  of  common  shares for the period. It also
requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share for companies
with  complex  structures.

Reclassification
- ----------------

Certain  amounts  in  the  financial  statements  have  been  reclassified to be
consistent  and  comparable  from  year-to-year.

Accounting  Pronouncements
- --------------------------

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin  No.  101  which  summarizes  certain  of the staff's views in applying
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  to revenue recognition in financial
statements.  The  Company does not anticipate a material impact on its financial
position  or  results  of  operations.
NOTE  1  -  SUMMARY  OF  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (Continued)
            ----------------------------------------------

In  April  2000,  the  FASB  issued  Financial  Interpretation  Number (FIN) 44,
Accounting  for  Certain  Transactions  Involving  Stock  Compensation--an
Interpretation  of  Accounting  Principles  Board  No.  25. FIN 44 clarifies the
application of Opinion No. 25. This Interpretation was effective immediately and
all  issues are to be handled prospectively. The adoption of FIN 44 did not have
a  material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Employee  Stock  Options
- ------------------------

The  Company  has a qualified and a nonqualified stock option plan which provide
for  the  granting  of  options  to  key employees, consultants, and nonemployee
directors  of the Company. The option price, number of shares and grant date are
determined  at  the  discretion  of  the  Company's  board of directors. Options
granted  under  the plans are exercisable immediately, however, the plan expires
in  August  2008.

The  Company  has elected to account for the stock option plans under Accounting
Principles  Board  Opinion  No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued for Employees,"
and  related  interpretations.  Accordingly,  no  compensation  expense has been
recognized  for  the  stock  option  plans.

The  fair  value of each option grant is estimated on the date of granting using
the  Black-Scholes  American  option-pricing  model  with  the  following
weighted-average  assumptions  used  for  grants in 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Expected  volatility of 89.28 and 89.97 percent for 2000 and 84.02 and 82.05 for
1999  and  risk-free  interest  rates  of  5.25  and 7.25 percent, respectively.

NOTE  7  -  FINANCIAL  INFORMATION  RELATING  TO  INDUSTRY  SEGMENTS
            --------------------------------------------------------

The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and
Related  Information  in  1998  which  changes  the  way  the  Company  reports
information  about  its  operating  segments.

The  Company identifies reportable segments by product and country, although the
Company  currently  does not have foreign country segments. The Company includes
revenues  from both external customers and revenues from transactions with other
operating  segments  in  its measure of segment profit or loss. The Company also
includes interest revenue and expense, DD&A, and other operating expenses in its
measure  of  segment  profit  or  loss.

The  accounting  policies  of  the  reportable  segments  are  the same as those
described  in  the  Summary  of  Significant Accounting Principles (see Note 1).

The  Company's  operations  are classified into two principal industry segments.
Following  is  a  summary  of  segmented  information  for  2000  and  1999:

Litigation
- ----------

During the year ended 1997, the Company filed an action in Contra Costa Superior
Court  against  an  unrelated  Corporation  (defendant)  for breach of contract,
declaratory  relief,  breach of confidence, deceit, negligent misrepresentation,
interference  with  prospective  economic  advantage,  unfair  competition,  and
constructive  trust.  The  matter  proceeded  to  trial on January 19, 1999, and
resulted  in  a  judgement for defendants. The judgement was entered in favor of
defendants  on  July  26, 1999.  Thereafter, defendants filed a motion for their
attorney fees pursuant to California Civil Code. On December 21, 1999, the Court
issued an order awarding attorneys' fees to defendants. On January 19, 2000, the
Company filed its appeal of the order.  In November 2000, the matter was settled
and  the  Company paid $600,000, which is included in general and administrative
expenses  as  reported  in results of operations for the year ended December 31,
2000.

<PAGE>
NOTE  9  -  COMMITMENTS  AND  CONTINGENCIES  (Continued)
            -------------------------------

On  May  7,  1998, the Company executed a note receivable with 3rd Mobile in the
amount of $125,000, and a Security Agreement dated May 9, 1997 which secured the
note.  The  Security  Agreement  indicates  that  the  Company  holds a security
interest  in  all  assets and personal property of 3rd Mobile including, but not
limited  to,  all  accounts  receivable,  office  equipment,  automobiles,
communications towers and business facilities and equipment, customer lists, FCC
licenses  (known  and  unknown),  pending  customer  orders, and work product in
progress,  together  with the proceeds thereof (the Collateral).  The Collateral
secures the amounts due under the $125,000 note, including interest, in addition
to  all  costs  and  fees,  including  attorneys' fees, in regard to enforcement
against  the Collateral.  During 1998, the note receivable went into default. An
action  was  filed by the Company against 3rd Mobile on June 23, 1999 in the New
York  Supreme Court, Onondaga County to foreclose on the Collateral.  Subsequent
to June 23, 1999, the Company learned that the Collateral was included as listed
assets  of  Central  New  York  Mobile  Systems, L.C., whom had filed Chapter 11
bankruptcy in Sacramento, California.  The Company believes that it properly and
legally  secured  its  interest in the Collateral and is awaiting the results of
disposition  from  the  bankruptcy  court.

Mining  Activities
- ------------------

On  March  22,  1999,  the Company and Placer Dome U.S., Inc. (PDUS), executed a
definitive  agreement  for  PDUS  to  explore, develop and mine approximately 36
square  miles  of the Company's then 61.5-square mile claim block at Richardson,
Alaska.  Terms  of  the  agreement  called  for PDUS to expend a minimum of $6.5
million  in work on the property and partially reimburse the Company for some of
its  previous  exploration, all within five years, in order for PDUS to earn 51%
interest  in  the  property. The Company received payments from PDUS totaling $0
and  $225,000  during  2000  and  1999, respectively, which has been recorded as
other  revenue.  After  spending  $750,000,  PDUS  terminated  this agreement on
September  18,  2000,  and the 36 square miles has reverted back to the Company.
Kennecott  Exploration  has  signed  a  confidentiality/non-compete agreement on
Tri-Valley's  entire  claim  block  plus  another  50  square miles surrounding.

Contingencies
- -------------

The Company is subject to possible loss contingencies pursuant to federal, state
and  local  environmental  laws  and  regulations.  These  include  existing and
potential  obligations  to  investigate  the  effects  of the release of certain
hydro-carbons  or  other  substances  at  various sites; to remediate or restore
these  sites; and to compensate others for damages and to make other payments as
required  by  law  or regulation. These obligations relate to sites owned by the
Company  or  others,  and  are  associated  with  past  and  present oil and gas
operations.  The  amount of such obligations is indeterminate and will depend on
such  factors  as  the  unknown  nature and extent of contamination, the unknown
timing,  extent  and  method  of  remedial  actions  which  may be required, the
determination  of  the  Company's  liability  in proportion to other responsible
parties,  and  the  state  of  the  law.

Leases
- ------

The  Company  leases  its  office  space  on  a  month  to  month  basis.

                             TRI-VALLEY CORPORATION
              SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ABOUT OIL AND GAS PRODUCING
                             ACTIVITIES (UNAUDITED)


The  following  estimates  of  proved  oil  and gas reserves, both developed and
undeveloped,  represent  interests  owned  by  the Company located solely in the
United  States.  Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and
natural  gas  which geological and engineering data demonstrate to be reasonably
certain  to  be  recoverable  in the future from known reservoirs under existing
economic  and  operating  conditions.  Proved developed oil and gas reserves are
reserves  that  can  be  expected  to  be recovered through existing wells, with
existing  equipment  and  operating  methods.  Proved  undeveloped  oil  and gas
reserves  are  reserves  that  are  expected  to  be recovered from new wells on
undrilled  acreage,  or  from  existing  wells  for  which  relatively  major
expenditures  are  required  for  completion.

Disclosures of oil and gas reserves which follow are based on estimates prepared
by  independent engineering consultants for the year ended December 31, 2000 and
1999.  Such  analyses  are  subject  to  numerous  uncertainties inherent in the
estimation  of  quantities  of  proved  reserves and in the projection of future
rates  of production and the timing of development expenditures. These estimates
do  not  include  probable  or  possible  reserves.

These  estimates are furnished and calculated in accordance with requirements of
the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  and  the  Securities  and Exchange
Commission  ("SEC").  Because of unpredictable variances in expenses and capital
forecasts,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  price changes, largely influenced and
controlled  by  U.S. and foreign government actions, and the fact that the basis
for  such  estimates  vary  significantly, management believes the usefulness of
these  projections  is  limited. Estimates of future net cash flows presented do
not  represent  management's  assessment  of future profitability or future cash
flows  to the Company. Management's investment and operating decisions are based
upon  reserve  estimates  that  include proved reserves prescribed by the SEC as
well  as  probable  reserves, and upon different price and cost assumptions from
those  used  here.

It  should be recognized that applying current costs and prices and a 10 percent
standard  discount  rate  does not convey absolute value. The discounted amounts
arrived  at  are  only  one  measure  of  the  value  of  proved  reserves.

Capitalized  costs  relating  to  oil  and  gas producing activities and related
accumulated  depletion,  depreciation  and  amortization  were  as  follows:

Standardized  measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and  gas  reserves
- ------------------

A  standardized  measure  of discounted future net cash flows is presented below
for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2000  and  1999.

The  future  net  cash  inflows  are  developed  as  follows:

     (1)Estimates  are  made  of  quantities  of  proved reserves and the future
periods during which they are expected to be produced based on year-end economic
conditions.
     (2)     The estimated future production of proved reserves is priced on the
basis  of  year-end  prices.
     (3)     The resulting future gross revenue streams are reduced by estimated
future  costs  to develop and to produce proved reserves, based on year end cost
estimates.
     (4)     The  resulting  future  net  revenue streams are reduced to present
value  amounts  by  applying  a  ten  percent  discount.

Disclosure  of  principal  components  of the standardized measure of discounted
future  net  cash  flows provides information concerning the factors involved in
making  the  calculation.  In  addition, the disclosure of both undiscounted and
discounted  net  cash  flows  provides a measure of comparing proved oil and gas
reserves  both  with  and  without  an  estimate  of  production  timing.  The
standardized  measure  of  discounted  future  net cash flows relating to proved
reserves  reflects  income  taxes.

This statement discloses the sources of changes in the standardized measure from
year  to  year.  The  amount  reported  as "Net changes in prices and production
costs"  represents  the  present value of changes in prices and production costs
multiplied by estimates of proved reserves as of the beginning of the year.  The
