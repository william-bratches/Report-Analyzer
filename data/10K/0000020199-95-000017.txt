                                     PART I


         Item 1:  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

         Church  Loans  &  Investments  Trust  ("the  Trust")  is a real  estate
         investment  trust  organized  under  the laws of the  State of Texas in
         March  1963.  Although  the  Trust has the  authority  to engage in the
         business of buying,  selling and leasing of real estate,  the Trust has
         heretofore restricted its business activities primarily to making loans
         to churches and other  nonprofit  organizations  which are secured by a
         first mortgage on real estate owned by such borrowers.

         The period of duration of the Trust,  unless  dissolved  in  accordance
         with law,  or by the  consent  of the  owners  of shares of  beneficial
         interest in the Trust, is perpetual.  The Trust may be dissolved by the
         affirmative  vote  of  not  less  than  two-thirds  of  the  owners  of
         outstanding   shares  of  the   Trust.   Owners  of   Secured   Savings
         Certificates,  a debt instrument  issued by the Trust,  have no vote in
         regard to any activities of the Trust, including dissolution.

         The  control and  management  of the Trust  properties,  and all powers
         necessary  or  appropriate  to effect any and all of the  purposes  for
         which the Trust is organized, is vested in the Board of Trust Managers.
         All managers are members of a congregation of the Church of Christ.

         The  number of shares of  beneficial  interest  in the Trust  which the
         Trust is authorized to issue is unlimited.

         The  Trust is  qualified  as a "real  estate  investment  trust"  under
         Sections  856-858 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the
         "Internal Revenue Code" or "Code"). It is the intention of the Trust to
         continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code.

         The Trust maintains an office located at 5305 I-40 West,  Amarillo,  TX
         79106 (telephone 806/358-3666).

         As mentioned above,  the Trust is primarily  engaged in the business of
         making  mortgage loans to churches and other  nonprofit  organizations.
         The  Declaration  of Trust  restricts the  investments  of the Trust to
         loans secured by a first mortgage, deed of trust or other lien covering
         real  property  with the  amount of such loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of
         the value of the real  property  securing  such loan as determined by a
         competent independent appraiser.  Although the Trust has been primarily
         in the business of making  long-term  mortgage  loans,  during the past
         several years it has been more involved in making short-term interim or
         construction loans to finance the construction of church buildings, the
         purchase of real

                                      -4-

<PAGE>



         estate, or the refinancing of existing indebtedness.  Most, if not all,
         of the interim loans  presently  being made by the Trust are associated
         with bond  offerings  of churches  and other  nonprofit  organizations.
         These interim loans are scheduled to be repaid from the proceeds of the
         bond offerings.

         The Trust is not limited to the location of the  property  securing any
         loans in which it may  invest and seeks to spread  its  investments  in
         areas of the United States where favorable yields prevail.

         As of March 31, 1995, the Trust has 194 permanent and interim  mortgage
         loans and  investments  in church bonds  having a principal  balance of
         $40,541,324,  with the average principal amount thereof being $208,976.
         The  interest  rates on these  loans vary from 7.0% to 15.75% per annum
         with the weighted  average  interest rate of mortgage  loans and church
         bonds being 10.94% per annum at March 31, 1995.  The original  terms of
         these loans vary form one year to thirty years, with the majority being
         for a term of twenty years.

         During the fiscal  year of the Trust  ending  March 31,  1995,  the net
         income of the Trust was $2,344,026, as compared to $2,288,342 in fiscal
         1994, an increase of 2.43%. The increase in net income of the Trust was
         due primarily to an increase in interest income and fees in fiscal 1995
         as compared to fiscal 1994 and in a decrease in  operating  expenses in
         fiscal 1995 compared to fiscal 1994.

         The net income of the Trust for each of the quarters during fiscal 1995
         was as follows: first quarter-$623,903; second quarter- $637,656; third
         quarter-$590,371; and fourth quarter-$492,096.

         The  operational  expense of the Trust  decreased from $579,850  during
         fiscal 1994 to $553,444 in fiscal 1995. The operational expenses of the
         Trust were approximately  12.56% of its gross income for the year ended
         March 31, 1995 as compared to 13.41% for the year ended March 31, 1994.
         The   operational   expense   of  the  Trust   included   general   and
         administrative  expenses  and  compensation  to members of the Board of
         Trust Managers.

         During  fiscal  1995,  the  Trust  made  36  loans  for   approximately
         $18,000,000.  Most,  if not  all,  of such  loans  bear  interest  at a
         variable  rate  equal to 2% per annum in  excess  of the prime  rate of
         interest  published  by the Wall Street  Journal and known as the "Wall
         Street Journal Prime."

         During fiscal 1995, the Trust employed a total of 4 full time employees
         and employed, as needed, one additional part-time employee.

                                      -5-

     Item 2:  DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES

         The Trust  maintains as its only place of business its offices  located
         at 5305 I-40 West,  in Amarillo,  Texas.  Such building is owned by the
         Trust and is  occupied  solely by the  Trust.  There is no debt owed by
         Trust in  regard to its real  property.  The  Trust  also owns  certain
         vacant land adjacent to the trust property that is held for investment.

         The real  properties of the Trust are not a significant  portion of the
         Trust's assets, representing less than 1% of the Trust's total assets.

         As previously mentioned,  the Trust's primary business is the making of
         mortgage  loans to  churches  and other  nonprofit  organizations.  The
         Declaration  of Trust  restricts the  investments of the Trust to loans
         secured by a first mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien covering real
         property  with the  amount  of such  loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of the
         value of the real property securing such loan. The Declaration of Trust
         may not be  amended  without  the vote of  two-thirds  (2/3 rds) of the
         Certificates  of  Beneficial  Interest  entitled to vote.  The Board of
         Trust Managers'  general policy is to limit  investment of Trust assets
         in any  one  mortgage  loan  to not  more  than  $2,000,000.  All  such
         investment in mortgage  loans is for the purpose of earning  income for
         the Trust.

                                    PART II


     Item 5:  MARKET FOR COMMON STOCK AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

         (a)      Market Information

         There  is no  established  public  trading  market  for the  shares  of
         beneficial interest of the Trust. During fiscal 1995 a total of 171,610
         shares were sold in the secondary  market at prices  ranging from $2.00
         to $2.50 per share.  The last sale  during the fiscal year was at $2.25
         per share.  During fiscal year 1994 a total of 222,319 shares were sold
         in the secondary market at prices ranging

                                      -6-

         from $1.80 to $2.40 per share.

         The range of high and low bid  information  for  shares  of  beneficial
         interest of the Trust for each quarter within the last two fiscal years
         is as follows:

                  Quarter           Fiscal  1995  Fiscal 1994

         (b)      Holders

         At March 31, 1995 there were 2,880 shareholders of the Trust.

         (c)      Dividends

         Cash dividends on all outstanding shares of beneficial  interest in the
         Trust are declared twice annually,  for the 3 month period ending March
         31, and the 9 month period ending December 31. In fiscal 1994 the Trust
         paid a cash dividend of $.31 per share. In fiscal 1995 the Trust paid a
         total cash dividend of $.34 per share.


     Item 6:  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION

         Results of Operations--1995 compared to 1994

         During the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995,  interest  income and fees
         of the Trust  increased by $83,825  (1.94%)  over the  previous  fiscal
         yeSuch increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the amount
         of  interim  construction  loans  held by the  Trust.  Earning  interim
         construction  loans  increased from  $7,035,506 as of March 31, 1994 to
         $10,148,958 as of March 31, 1995.  However,  earning mortgage loans and
         church  bonds  decreased  from  $28,079,612  as of  March  31,  1994 to
         $25,676,746  as of March 31, 1995.  Such decrease is primarily a result
         of the normal  payoff upon  maturity of loans held by the Trust as well
         as the  payoff  prior to  maturity  of loans  held by the  Trust.  Such
         increase  in  interest  income  and fees was  also  attributable  to an
         increase in the average annual  interest rate on loans and church bonds
         from 10.46% at March 31, 1994 to 10.94% at March 31, 1995.

         In fiscal 1995, the average aggregate amount of total debt
         outstanding was $91,365 more than in fiscal 1994.  Furthermore,

                                      -7-

<PAGE>



         interest expense increased by $112,870. Such increase was primarily due
         to an increase in the Trust's  cost of funds.  The increase in the debt
         of the Trust was  primarily due to an increase in interim loans made by
         the Trust.  The approximate  weighted average annual interest rate upon
         the aggregate  outstanding debt increased from 6.61% during fiscal 1994
         to 7.29% during fiscal 1995.

         The net income of the Trust increased $55,684 (2.43%) from the previous
         fiscal year. Such increase was primarily attributable to an increase in
         interest  income and fees in fiscal 1995 as compared to fiscal 1994 and
         in a decrease in operating  expenses in fiscal 1995  compared to fiscal
         1994.

         During fiscal 1995,  the prime  interest rate  increased  from 6.25% at
         March 31,  1994 to 9.0% per annum at March 31,  1995.  Should the prime
         interest rate decrease during fiscal 1996, the interest  expense of the
         Trust will  generally  decrease and the net income of the Trust will in
         turn generally increase. Should the prime interest rate increase during
         fiscal 1996, the interest expense of the Trust will generally  increase
         and the net income of the Trust will in turn generally decrease.

         Principal payments received on the interim and permanent loan portfolio
         and the  church  bonds  held by the Trust  decreased  from  $16,055,666
         during  fiscal 1994, to  $15,623,167  during fiscal 1995, a decrease of
         2.69%.  This  decrease was  primarily  attributable  to the decrease in
         mortgage loans held by the Trust during these respective periods and to
         an  increase in the amount of  non-performing  loans as compared to the
         entire loan  portfolio of the Trust  during  fiscal 1995 as compared to
         the previous  fiscal  year.  The  non-performing  loans of the Trust as
         compared to the entire loan portfolio of the Trust increased from 4.15%
         as of March 31, 1994 to 8.68% as of March 31,  1995.  This  increase is
         primarily  attributable  to one interim  construction  loan which had a
         principal  balance of  $1,520,977  at March 31,  1995.  The loan became
         delinquent  during the latter part of 1994 and was placed on nonaccrual
         status  and  all  accrued  interest  was   written-off.   The  loan  is
         collateralized  by a church  building and management  believes that the
         potential  loss,  if any, is  adequately  provided in the allowance for
         possible  credit  losses at March 31, 1995.  Management  has  initiated
         proceedings to foreclose the collateral securing such loan.


         Results of Operations--1994 compared to 1993

         During the fiscal year ended March 31, 1994,  interest  income and fees
         of the Trust  decreased by $218,592  (4.81%)  over the previous  fiscal
         yeSuch decrease was primarily  attributable to a decrease in the amount
         of mortgage loans held by the Trust.  Earning mortgage loans and church
         bonds decreased from $35,375,304

                                      -8-

<PAGE>



         as of March 31, 1993 to $28,079,612 as of March 31, 1994. Such decrease
         is primarily a result of the normal  payoff upon maturity of loans held
         by the Trust as well as the payoff  prior to  maturity of loans held by
         the  Trust.  Such  decrease  in  interest  income  and  fees  was  also
         attributable  to a decrease  in the  average  annual  interest  rate on
         mortgage loans and church bonds from 11.05% at March 31, 1993 to 10.46%
         at March 31, 1994.

         In fiscal 1994, the average  aggregate amount of total debt outstanding
         was  $2,155,952  more than in fiscal 1993.  However,  interest  expense
         actually  decreased by $225,551.  Such  decrease was primarily due to a
         decrease in the Trust's cost of funds.  The increase in the debt of the
         Trust was  primarily  due to an increase  in interim  loans made by the
         Trust.  The approximate  weighted average annual interest rate upon the
         aggregate  outstanding  debt decreased from 7.64% during fiscal 1993 to
         6.61% during fiscal 1994.

         The net income of the Trust increased $87,918 (4.00%) from the previous
         fiscal year.  Such increase was primarily  attributable to the decrease
         in interest expense in fiscal 1994 as compared to 1993, the decrease in
         the  provision  for possible  credit  losses in fiscal 1994 compared to
         fiscal  1993 and from the payoff  prior to  maturity  of several  loans
         purchased by the Trust from the Resolution  Trust  Corporation  ("RTC")
         and the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC") in previous
         years  resulting in a realization  into income of the discount  between
         the payoff of a particular  loan and the purchase price of a particular
         loan.

         During fiscal 1994,  the prime  interest rate  increased  from 6.00% at
         March 31, 1993 to 6.25% per annum at March 31, 1994.

         Principal payments received on the interim and permanent loan portfolio
         and the  church  bonds  held by the Trust  decreased  from  $16,711,276
         during  fiscal 1993, to  $16,055,666  during fiscal 1994, a decrease of
         3.92%.  This  decrease was  primarily  attributable  to the decrease in
         mortgage loans held by the Trust during these respective periods. There
         was no  material  change  in the  amount  of  non-performing  loans  as
         compared to the entire loan  portfolio of the Trust during  fiscal 1994
         as compared to the previous fiscal year.


         Liquidity and Capital Resources

         The Trust is engaged in the  business of making  permanent  and interim
         loans to churches and other non-profit organizations. The assets of the
         Trust primarily  consist of its loan portfolio with the Trust owning no
         real  property  other  than its office  building  and  facilities.  The
         operational expense of the Trust is comprised of the maintenance of its
         office  building,  the payment of the  salaries of its  management  and
         clerical staff and the payment for

                                      -9-

<PAGE>



         legal and accounting  services.  Substantially  all of the Trust assets
         are invested in the permanent and interim loans made by the Trust.  The
         only  potential  liquidity  problems  of the Trust are  related  to the
         timely and proper  repayment by the Trust of the leveraged funds it has
         borrowed  to  make  loans  in  excess  of  its  capital.   All  of  the
         indebtedness of the Trust is generally  classified as short term having
         maturities  ranging  from "on  demand"  to  maturities  repayable  over
         various periods extending through 1998.

         The  annual   maturities  upon  all  debt   obligations  of  the  Trust
         outstanding  as of March 31, 1995 for the next three  fiscal years are:
         1996--$14,322,712;  1997--$2,915,377;  and 1998-$1,285,000.  These debt
         obligations  primarily consist of the Trust's bank line of credit, bank
         term loans and Secured Savings Certificates ("Certificates") which have
         been  previously  issued by the Trust.  Certificates  outstanding as of
         March 31,  1995 that will  mature  during  the next  three  years  are:
         1996--$3,833,354;  1997--$1,915,377; and 1998-$1,035,000. The principal
         amount of the Trust's  bank term notes which will mature in each of the
         next   three   years  are   1996--$1,416,667;   1997--$1,000,000;   and
         1998-$250,000.

         At March 31, 1995 loans to the Trust under Master Note Agreements which
         are in effect demand notes total $3,472,690. In the past, the Trust has
         utilized its bank line of credit,  principal paid to the Trust upon its
         outstanding loan portfolio,  and the proceeds received from the sale of
         Certificates in order to meet its maturing obligations.  Effective July
         18, 1994, the Trust decided not to register  Certificates and therefore
         the  Trust is  presently  unable  to sell and has been  unable  to sell
         Certificates  since July 18,  1994.  However,  the Trust has decided to
         register additional Certificates in the summer of 1995.

         At March 31,  1995,  the  balance  which could be borrowed by the Trust
         upon its bank line of credit was  $4,399,999.  The  principal  payments
         scheduled to be received by the Trust upon its loan  portfolio  for the
         years ending March 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 are $16,618,243, $2,546,974,
         and $2,376,248, respectively. Assuming all of these scheduled principal
         payments  are  received,  these  payments,  together  with the  balance
         available  to Church  Loans on its bank  line of  credit,  would  allow
         Church Loans to have sufficient  funds to meet its maturing  obligation
         without the  necessity  for Church Loans having to sell any  additional
         Certificates or borrow funds from other sources.

         During fiscal 1995,  1994 and 1993 the Trust sold  Certificates  in the
         principal   amounts  of   $5,239,231,   $5,185,803,   and   $9,619,445,
         respectively.  Due to the  cost of  registration  and of  sales of such
         Certificates, the cost of these funds are normally higher than the cost
         of borrowing  from bank sources or master  notes.  As mentioned  above,
         effective   July  18,   1994,   the  Trust   decided  not  to  register
         Certificates. Therefore, the Trust was unable to sell Certificates

                                      -10-

<PAGE>



         since such date and is presently unable to sell Certificates.  However,
         the Trust has decided to register  additional  Certificates  during the
         summer  of  1995.   Based  upon  the  success  of  the  Trust  to  sell
         Certificates  in the past,  the Trust is confident  that,  should it be
         necessary,  it  will be able to  sell  Certificates  in the  future  in
         sufficient amounts for the Trust to timely meet all of its obligations.
         To the extent that  Certificates  sold by the Trust have maturity dates
         of one year, or less, the financial condition of the Trust would not be
         substantially  improved  since the proceeds  received by the Trust from
         the  sale  of  Certificates  will,  of  necessity,  be  used to pay the
         principal and interest upon Certificates maturing in this period.

         Should  all the  scheduled  principal  payments  upon loans made by the
         Trust  not be  received,  and  should  the  Trust  be  unable  to  sell
         Certificates  with  maturity  dates and in amounts  described  above or
         should the Trust be unable to borrow  against  its line of credit,  and
         should loans from other  sources not be available it would be necessary
         for the Trust to sell a portion of its mortgage loan portfolio in order
         for it to meet all of its financial obligations. At March 31, 1995, the
         principal  balance of the loan and church bond  portfolio  of the Trust
         was $39,231,497. The weighted average interest rate on loans and church
         bonds was  10.94% per annum.  In view of the  normal  marketability  of
         conventional  loans,  the Trust would  probably be required to discount
         the great  majority of these  loans in order for them to be  attractive
         for  purchase.  The  principal  amount of these loans if  discounted to
         yield a weighted  average  interest  rate of 12%,  14% and 16% would be
         $35,766,050,  $30,656,614, and $26,824,538,  respectively.  There is no
         assurance  that the Trust  would be able to sell all,  or a portion of,
         its portfolio of loans,  in which event,  it would be necessary for the
         Trust to secure a loan, or loans,  from a lender in order for the Trust
         to meet its financial obligations. There is no assurance that the Trust
         would be able to  secure a loan in such  instance.  The  Trust has sold
         only one of the loans in its mortgage loan  portfolio and therefore has
         limited experience in this area.

         Principal  payments  scheduled  to be  received  by the Trust  upon its
         permanent loan portfolio  during the years ending March 31, 1996,  1997
         and 1998,  if not used to fund new loan  commitments,  would be used to
         reduce the outstanding  indebtedness of the Trust. Should the Trust use
         the  payments  of  principal  which  shall  be  received  upon its loan
         portfolio to reduce its outstanding indebtedness,  the interest expense
         of the Trust will decrease.  In such instance,  whether the decrease in
         the interest  income will exceed,  or be less than, the decrease in the
         interest  expense  will  largely  be  dependent  upon the prime rate of
         interest  prevailing  at such time due to the fact that the interest to
         be earned by the Trust upon its  mortgage  loan  portfolio is generally
         based upon a fixed rate of interest or a variable rate of interest that
         periodically reprices,  while the interest to be paid by the Trust upon
         its  outstanding  debts is directly,  or indirectly,  tied to the prime
         rate of

                                      -11-

<PAGE>



         interest charged by major domestic banks.

         As of March 31, 1995, a  substantial  portion of the  promissory  notes
         evidencing  the loans made by the Trust have been pledged to secure its
         outstanding  indebtedness.  At March 31, 1995  promissory  notes in the
         principal amount of $9,676,303 had been pledged to secure  Certificates
         which had been  previously sold by the Trust.  The required  collateral
         for  these  Certificates  (based  on the  ratio  of 1.25 to 1 of  notes
         pledged to the principal  balance of the  Certificates) was $8,479,664,
         leaving an excess of  promissory  notes which have been  pledged by the
         Trust  to  secure  said   Certificates  of  $1,196,639.   Additionally,
         promissory  notes totalling  $14,452,698 were pledged against a line of
         credit and notes payable to banks which had a total outstanding balance
         of  $8,266,668.  The  required  collateral  for  these  bank  loans was
         $9,360,001,  leaving  an excess of  promissory  notes  which  have been
         pledged  to  secure  said  bank  notes  of  $5,092,697.   These  excess
         promissory notes may be reassigned by the Indenture  Trustee or bank to
         the  Trust to be sold in  order  for the  Trust  to meet its  financial
         obligations.  Should it be necessary in order for the Trust to meet its
         financial  obligations,  these excess notes amounting to $6,289,336 and
         other  additional   promissory  notes  in  the  approximate  amount  of
         $15,102,496  (for a total amount of $21,391,832)  would be available to
         be sold by the  Trust to meet its  financial  obligations.  Should  the
         excess promissory notes be assigned by the Indenture Trustee or bank to
         the Trust as heretofore described, all outstanding Certificates sold by
         the Trust, bank line of credit,  and bank term loans, would continue to
         be  secured by the  required  ratio of notes  pledged to the  principal
         balance  of these  Certificates,  bank  line of  credit,  and bank term
         loans.  There is no assurance that the Trust would be able to sell all,
         or any portion of these notes.

         Cash flows from operating  activities consists primarily of net income.
         The primary  components of net income are interest  income and expense.
         Interest  income should continue to be the main source of cash provided
         by operating activities; however, the availability of this cash flow is
         dependent  upon the ability of the  borrowers to repay loans.  Although
         there was an  increase  in the  amount of  non-performing  loans of the
         Trust as of March 31, 1995 compared to March 31, 1994, this increase is
         primarily  attributable to one interim construction loan and management
         does  not  expect  material  increases  in such  loans  in the  future.
         Accordingly,  cash  provided by  operating  activities  has been and is
         expected to be a relatively stable source of cash flow.

         Cash flows from investing  activities results primarily from investment
         in and payments received on mortgage and interim construction loans and
         church bonds.

         Cash flows from financing  activities  relate  primarily to the sale of
         and  payments on  Certificates  and  borrowings  and  payments on notes
         payable and the line of credit. Certificates are sold and

                                      -12-

<PAGE>



         borrowings  are made as funds are  needed to make  loans or as  current
         obligations  become due.  Although the Trust has not sold  Certificates
         since  July 18,  1994,  based upon the  Trust's  decision  to  register
         Certificates  during the summer of 1995 and the success of the Trust to
         sell  Certificates  and  obtain  borrowings  in the past,  the Trust is
         confident  that  it  will be  able  to  sell  Certificates  and  obtain
         borrowings in the future in sufficient amounts,  along with payments to
         be received on loans, to timely meet its obligations.


         Disclosure of Impact of Recently Issued Account Standards

         See Note (3) to the Financial  Statements on pages 20 through 23 of the
         1995  Annual  Report to  Shareholders  for  information  regarding  the
         expected impact of recently issued accounting standards.


         Inflation

         At March 31, 1995, the weighted  average  interest rate on the mortgage
         loan and church bond  portfolio of the Trust was 10.94% per annum while
         the weighted average interest rate upon all borrowings of the Trust was
         8.02% per annum. Although a majority of the loans constituting the loan
         portfolio  of the Trust have been made at  variable  rates of  interest
         that  generally  reprice  annually,  approximately  23.3% of the  loans
         constituting  the Trust's loan  portfolio have been made at fixed rates
         of  interest  and  therefore  are not  subject  to being  increased  or
         decreased  during the term of the loan. All of the  indebtedness of the
         Trust is  either  directly  or  indirectly  tied to the  prime  rate of
         interest charged by major banking institutions and therefore is subject
         to fluctuation. During periods of inflation, the prime rate of interest
         charged by major banking institutions,  as well as the interest rate or
         cost  of  borrowing  money  from  any  lender,   generally   increases.
         Consequently, during an inflationary period the interest expense of the
         Trust would increase.  Since the interest income of the Trust would not
         increase as rapidly,  an increase in the interest  expense of the Trust
         would decrease the net income of the Trust.  However,  interest  income
         should subsequently increase as variable rate loans reprice. Should the
         amount  of the loans and the  amount of the  indebtedness  of the Trust
         remain constant, and should the weighted average interest rate upon the
         indebtedness  increase to approximately  23.79% per annum, the interest
         income and the  interest  expense of the Trust  would be  substantially
         equal.

     Item 8:  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON
              ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

         KPMG Peat Marwick LLP was previously the principal  accountants for the
         Trust.  As of June 1, 1995,  KPMG Peat  Marwick LLP sold its  Amarillo,
         Texas office to Clifton,  Gunderson & Co.  Therefore,  on June 14, 1995
         the Trust  dismissed  KPMG Peat Marwick LLP as the Trust's  independent
         auditors.  The decision to change accountants was approved by the Board
         of Trust Managers.

         The KPMG Peat Marwick LLP report on the  financial  statements  for the
         past two fiscal years did not contain any adverse  opinion,  disclaimer
         of opinion,  nor any  qualification  or modification as to uncertainty,
         audit scope, or accounting principles.

         Furthermore,  there were no disagreements with KPMG Peat Marwick LLP on
         any matter of accounting  principles or practices,  financial statement
         disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements if not
         resolved to their satisfaction would have caused them to make reference
         in  connection  with  their  opinion  to  the  subject  matter  of  the
         disagreement  in regard to the audits of the fiscal  years  ended March
         31, 1994 and March 31, 1995 and the  subsequent  interim period through
         June 14,  1995.  A letter  from KPMG Peat  Marwick  LLP is  attached as

                          Independent Auditors' Report
                          ----------------------------


The Board of Trust Managers and Shareholders
Church Loans & Investments Trust:

We have audited the  accompanying  balance  sheets of Church Loans & Investments
Trust (a real estate  investment  trust) as of March 31, 1995 and 1994,  and the
related statements of income,  shareholders'  equity, and cash flows for each of
the years in the  three-year  period  ended  March  31,  1995.  These  financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the  financial  position of Church Loans &  Investments
Trust as of March 31, 1995 and 1994,  and the results of its  operations and its
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year  period ended March 31, 1995,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                         Notes to Financial Statements

                   Years ended March 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993

(1)      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         GENERAL

         Church  Loans &  Investments  Trust  (Church  Loans)  is a real  estate
         investment  trust that invests  primarily in mortgage loans to churches
         across the United States,  particularly in the southern  portion of the
         U.S.  During 1995,  Church Loans also began making certain interim real
         estate construction loans to entities other than churches. Church Loans
         requires that real estate  properties be pledged against mortgage loans
         as  security  which  could be  foreclosed  by Church  Loans  should the
         borrower default. Repayment of each borrower's obligations is generally
         expected to be repaid from contributions from church members, or in the
         case of interim  construction loans, by permanent financing provided by
         others.

         CURRENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

         Church  Loans  has  historically  invested  in  long-term,   fixed-rate
         mortgage  loans,  generally  funded by  relatively  short-term  secured
         savings  certificates  (SSCs) and debt  obligations.  The volatility of
         interest rates and increased  competition to attract  customers'  funds
         have caused Church Loans' liability  structure to become short-term and
         rate sensitive. Church Loans reflected an average interest yield on its
         loan and church bond portfolio,  an average  interest rate on its total
         indebtedness and a net interest rate margin at March 31, 1995, 1994 and
         1993 as follows:
                                       Loan and church     Total    Net interest
                                        bond portfolio indebtedness rate margin
                                       --------------- ------------ ------------
         March 31, 1995 ...................  10.94         8.02          2.92
         March 31, 1994 ...................  10.46         6.25          4.21
         March 31, 1993 ...................  11.05         7.14          3.91

         Church Loans finances  maturities of SSCs and debt obligations  through
         its  available  lines of credit,  the  issuance  of SSCs and  principal
         payments received on its mortgage loans.

         CHURCH BONDS

         Church bonds, secured by first mortgage liens on church facilities, are
         stated  at  cost,  as there  is no  traded  market  for the  bonds  and
         management intends to hold such securities until maturity.

         ALLOWANCE FOR POSSIBLE CREDIT LOSSES

         The  allowance  for possible  credit  losses is  established  through a
         provision  for possible  credit  losses  charged to expense.  Loans and
         church bonds are charged against the allowance when management believes
         that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely.

         Recoveries  of  amounts  previously  charged  off are  credited  to the
         allowance. The charge to operations is based on management's evaluation
         of the loan and church bond  portfolio,  including  such factors as the
         security  collateralizing  the loans or church bonds,  past credit loss
         experience and general economic conditions.

                                      -18-

         RECOGNITION OF INTEREST  INCOME,  ORIGINATION  AND COMMITMENT  FEES AND
         LOAN DISCOUNTS

         Interest  income on mortgage loans and church bonds is recognized  when
         earned.  The accrual of interest  income is generally  discontinued  on
         mortgage  loans  and  church  bonds  more than 90 days past due or when
         there is sufficient doubt as to the collection of interest.

         Loan  origination  fees are collected only on a few permanent loans and
         generally  recognized as income when received and the  associated  loan
         origination  costs  are  expensed  when  incurred.  The  effect  on the
         accompanying  financial  statements is not  materially  different  from
         generally accepted accounting  principles which require that loan fees,
         net of  origination  costs,  be deferred and  amortized  into  interest
         income over the life of the related loan.

         Commitment fees received on interim  construction  loans are recognized
         over the interim  commitment  period for loans that are not permanently
         financed  by Church  Loans and over the life of the  mortgage  loan for
         loans that are permanently  financed by Church Loans. Amounts are being
         amortized  using  the  straight-line   method.   This  method  was  not
         materially different from the method of deferring commitment fees until
         the commitment is exercised and recognizing  such fees as an adjustment
         to yield  by the  interest  method  over the  related  loans'  lives as
         prescribed by generally accepted accounting  principles for each of the
         years in the three-year period ended March 31, 1995.

         Purchase discounts on loans are amortized based on the interest method.

         PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

         Property  and   equipment   are  stated  at  cost,   less   accumulated
         depreciation. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over
         the  estimated  useful  lives of the  assets,  which range from 3 to 18
         years.

         UNAMORTIZED DEBT EXPENSE

         Commissions paid to brokers (see note 2) in connection with the sale of
         SSCs  are  deferred  and  amortized  over  the  terms  of  the  related
         certificates on the interest method.  Costs incurred in connection with
         the   registration   of  SSCs  are  deferred   and   amortized  on  the
         straight-line method over the period the related certificates are sold,
         but no longer  than two years  from the date the  registration  becomes
         effective.

         INCOME TAXES

         In February  1992,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)
         issued Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting
         for Income  Taxes.  Statement  109  requires a change from the deferred
         method of  accounting  for income  taxes of APB Opinion 11 to the asset
         and liability  method of accounting  for income taxes.  Under the asset
         and  liability  method  of  Statement  109,  deferred  tax  assets  and
         liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
         to  differences  between the financial  statement  carrying  amounts of
         existing  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  respective  tax  bases.
         Deferred  tax assets and  liabilities  are measured  using  enacted tax
         rates  expected to apply to taxable  income in the years in which those
         temporary  differences  are expected to be recovered or settled.  Under
         Statement  109, the effect on deferred tax assets and  liabilities of a
         change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
         the enactment date.

         Pursuant to the deferred method under APB Opinion 11, which was applied
         in 1993 and prior  years,  deferred  income taxes were  recognized  for
         income and  expense  items that were  reported in  different  years for
         financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes using the tax rate
         applicable for the year of the calculation.  Under the deferred method,
         deferred taxes were not adjusted for  subsequent  changes in tax rates.
         Statement  109 was  adopted  effective  April 1, 1993 on a  prospective
         basis and the effect of adoption was not  significant  to Church Loans'
         financial statements.

         CASH FLOWS

         For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
         cash-on-hand, investment in a money market mutual fund and certificates
         of  deposit  with  maturities  of less  than  90  days  at the  time of
         acquisition.

(2)      BROKER FEES

         Church Loans had an agreement with Great Nation Investment  Corporation
         (Great Nation)  whereby Great Nation used its best efforts to sell SSCs
         registered  by Church Loans.  The agreement  provided that Church Loans
         would pay Great Nation a commission on the basis of an annualized  rate
         equal to  three-fourths  of one percent per annum of the face amount of
         each certificate sold by Great Nation.  Effective July 18, 1994, Church
         Loans  decided  not  to  register  and  is  presently  unable  to  sell
         additional SSCs (see note 4).

(3)      MORTGAGE AND INTERIM CONSTRUCTION LOANS

         Mortgage loans receivable  consist of conventional loans of $26,604,107
         and $28,564,372 and interest-bearing  church bonds due principally from
         congregations of Churches of Christ of $957,455 and $1,034,580 at March
         31,  1995  and  1994,  respectively.   Interim  construction  loans  of
         $11,669,935  and  $7,035,506 at March 31, 1995 and 1994,  respectively,
         consist  primarily of loans to churches for the  construction of church
         facilities. Mortgage loans, church bonds and interim construction loans
         are generally secured by first liens on real estate comprised primarily
         of church buildings,  ministers'  residences and other real estate. The
         amount of a loan is generally limited to 66-2/3% of the appraised value
         of the related  property.  Certain  loans are  guaranteed by individual
         members of the  congregations  or other  individuals or  congregations,
         depending on the circumstances. The individual endorsements are usually
         for a  specific  amount  with the sum of all such  guarantees  being an
         amount at least equal to the loan amount.

         Church  Loans'  portfolio  included  mortgage  loans,  church bonds and
         interim  construction  loans with interest  rates ranging from 7.00% to
         15.75% at March 31, 1995. The weighted average annual interest rates of
         Church Loans' loan and church bond  portfolio were 10.94% and 10.46% at
         March 31, 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  The  weighted  average  annual
         interest rates for the loan and church bond  portfolios  were 11.0% for
         the year  ended  March 31,  1995 and 11.2% for each of the years  ended
         March 31, 1994 and 1993.

         In the normal  course of business,  Church Loans makes  commitments  to
         extend  credit  which are not  reflected in the  financial  statements.
         These commitments  involve elements of credit risk, interest rate risk,
         liquidity  risk and market risk.  At March 31,  1995,  Church Loans had
         outstanding  loan  commitments (by contract  amounts) of  approximately
         $1,824,000.  Church  Loans  has no  other  financial  instruments  with
         off-balance sheet risk.

         Nonaccrual mortgage loans, church bonds and interim  construction loans
         at March  31,  1995,  1994 and 1993  were  $3,405,793,  $1,519,340  and
         $1,641,561,   respectively.  Interest  income  which  would  have  been
         recorded under the original terms of nonaccrual  loans and church bonds
         amounted to  $282,551,  $171,367 and $186,266 for the years ended March
         31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  No interest income was actually
         recognized.

         The  original  terms  of the  individual  loans  included  in the  loan
         portfolio  generally  vary  from 1 to 30  years.  Scheduled  maturities
         during the five years subsequent to March 31, 1995, are:

         In  May  1993,  the  FASB  issued  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
         Standards No. 114,  Accounting  by Creditors for  Impairment of a Loan.
         This Statement  amends FASB Nos. 5, Accounting for  Contingencies,  and
         15,   Accounting   by  Debtors  and   Creditors   for   Troubled   Debt
         Restructurings,  and  prescribes  the  recognition  criterion  for loan
         impairment and the measurement  methods for certain  impaired loans and
         loans whose terms are  modified in  troubled-debt  restructurings.  The
         objective of  Statement  114 is to provide  consistent  guidance to all
         creditors with loans included in the scope of the Statement.  Statement
         114 is effective for financial  statements  for fiscal years  beginning
         after December 15, 1994 and is required to be adopted prospectively. In
         October  1994,  the  FASB  issued  Statement  No.  118,  Accounting  by
         Creditors  for   Impairment  of  a  Loan  -  Income   Recognition   and
         Disclosures.  Statement  No.  118 amends  Statement  No. 114 to allow a
         creditor to use existing methods for recognizing  interest income on an
         impaired loan and amends certain disclosure requirements.  The adoption
         of  Statements  No.  114 and No.  118 on April  1,  1995 did not have a
         material effect on Church Loans financial statements.

         Maturities of SSCs and debt obligations are financed through  principal
         payments  received on mortgage  loans,  advances on other  demand notes
         payable  and  advances  on the  $10,000,000  line of  credit  which  is
         expected to be renewed on an annual basis.

         Descriptions of the various categories of debt obligations follow:

         SECURED SAVINGS CERTIFICATES

         SSCs are issued in amounts of $1,000 or more and have  single  maturity
         dates from 30 days to 10 years from date of issue.  With  respect to an
         individual  certificate,  interest  rate and  frequency  of  payment of
         interest  (either  monthly,  quarterly,  semiannually,  annually  or at
         maturity)  are fixed at the time of  issuance  of the  certificate.  As
         discussed in note 2, effective July 18, 1994,  Church Loans decided not
         to register and is presently unable to sell additional  SSCs.  However,
         during  April  1995,  the Board of Trust  Managers  decided to register
         additional SSCs in the summer of 1995.

         The  certificates  are  secured  under the terms of an  indenture  that
         requires,  among other things,  the pledge of mortgage notes receivable
         with total unpaid principal amounts not less than 125% of the aggregate
         principal  amount of SSCs  outstanding.  Due to the fluctuations in the
         amount of sales of  certificates  as well as in the  repayment of notes
         pledged to secure the certificates, Church Loans has on occasion failed
         to  maintain  the  required  ratio  of  pledged  notes  to  outstanding
         certificates  for a short period of time until the deficiency  could be
         corrected.  The  indenture  trustee  has been aware of these  temporary
         technical  defaults  of Church  Loans and has waived  declaration  of a
         default  under the  Indenture.  As of March 31,  1995 and 1994,  Church
         Loans was in compliance with the requirement.

         TERM NOTES PAYABLE TO BANKS

         Church  Loans  has two term  notes  payable  to banks  that each had an
         original  principal  sum of  $5,000,000.  One  note has a term of three
         years and is payable in monthly  installments  of  $138,889.  The other
         note has a term of five years and is payable in monthly installments of
         $83,333.

         Both term notes payable to banks bear interest at prime plus 1% (10% at
         March 31, 1995) and are  collateralized  by mortgage  loans  receivable
         with carrying values equal to at least 120% of the aggregate  principal
         amount of the outstanding notes,  subject to certain  limitations.  All
         collateral is cross-pledged against the Line of Credit Payable to Bank.

         The term notes are subject to loan agreements that require, among other
         things,  that Church Loans' net worth not be less than  $18,000,000 and
         its total indebtedness shall not exceed 150% of its net worth. At March
         31,  1995,   Church  Loans'  total   indebtedness   was   approximately
         $13,400,000 less than the maximum amount permitted under the agreement.

         LINE OF CREDIT PAYABLE TO BANK

         Line of credit  payable to bank  consists  of  borrowings  under a loan
         agreement  effective  through  September 1, 1995,  that  provides for a
         $10,000,000  line of credit with a  commitment  fee of 1/4% to 3/8% per
         annum on the unadvanced  portion.  The loan agreement  requires  Church
         Loans to pledge  mortgage  loans  receivable  having  unpaid  principal
         balances  with an aggregate  present  value,  discounted at 1% over the
         prime  rate  (10% at March  31,  1995),  of not less  than  110% of all
         indebtedness   owed  to  the  bank.   Such   pledged   loans  are  also
         cross-pledged against the Term Notes Payable to Banks. Interest accrues
         at the prime rate and is payable semiannually.

         The loan  agreement  contains  restrictions  similar  to  those  limits
         contained in the loan agreements  relating to the Term Notes Payable to
         Banks and also limits demand notes payable to $4,000,000 ($2,000,000 in
         1994).

         DEMAND NOTES PAYABLE

         The demand notes  payable bear  interest at 1% less than the prime rate
         (payable monthly) and are unsecured (see note 8).

(5)      INCOME TAX PROVISION

         Church Loans has elected to be taxed as a real estate  investment trust
         under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a real
         estate  investment trust under the Code, Church Loans must, among other
         things,   distribute  at  least  95%  of  its  taxable  income  to  its
         shareholders  through  dividends.  Church  Loans  is  required  to  pay
         dividends of at least 85% of its calendar year undistributed  income by
         February 1 or be subject to a special  federal  excise tax of 4% on the
         undistributed amount.

         As discussed in note 1, Church Loans adopted  Statement 109 as of April
         1, 1993. The cumulative  effect of this change in accounting for income
         taxes and the related  deferred  taxes were not  significant  to Church
         Loans' financial statements.

        Total income tax expense for the years ended March 31,  1995,  1994 and
         1993 is less  than the  amount  computed  by  applying  the  applicable
         statutory federal income tax rate (35% for 1995 and 1994, respectively,
         and 34% for  1993) to  income  before  provision  for  income  taxes as
         follows:

(6)      NET INCOME PER SHARE

         Net income per share of  beneficial  interest is based on the  weighted
         average number of shares  outstanding,  which was 7,007,402 for each of
         the years  ended  March 31,  1995,  1994 and 1993.  There were no share
         equivalents or other potentially dilutive securities outstanding during
         any of the periods presented.

(7)      DIVIDENDS

         All  dividends  paid by Church Loans are taxable as ordinary  income to
         the  recipient.  A schedule  of  dividends  paid during the years ended
         March 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 follows:

(8)      RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         Other demand notes  payable at March 31, 1995 and 1994  included  notes
         totaling   $706,577  and  $364,155,   respectively,   which   represent
         borrowings  from related  parties.  The notes bear  interest at 1% less
         than the prime rate and are  unsecured.  Interest  expense  incurred on
         related party other demand notes payable was not  significant for 1995,
         1994 or 1993 (see note 4).

         Secured  savings  certificates  at March  31,  1995  and  1994  include

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:

We were previously  principal  accountants for Church Loans & Investments  Trust
and,  under the date of May 5, 1995, we reported on the financial  statements of
Church Loans & Investments Trust as of March 31, 1995 and 1994 and for the three
year period ended March 31, 1995. On June 14, 1995 our  appointment as principal
accountants  was  terminated.  We have read  Church  Loans &  Investments  Trust
statements  included  under  Item 4 of its Form  8-K  dated  June  14,  1995 and
included  under Item 4 of its Form 8-K/A dated June 28, 1995,  and we agree with
such statements,  except that we are not in a position to agree or disagree with
Church Loans & Investments Trust's statement that the change was approved by the
Board of Trust Managers.

                                              Very truly yours,
