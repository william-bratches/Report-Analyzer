Net Income increased $36,086, 2,357%, in 2002 as compared with 2001.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUED


Dividend and interest income decreased $45,850, 63.8%, in 2002
as compared with 2001.  The decrease in dividend and interest
income in 2002 compared with 2001 was due to a decrease in rates
earned by the Company.

Total operating expenses decreased $70,241, 49.4%, in 2002 as compared
with 2001.  Salaries and payroll costs decreased $48,221, 99.11%,
in 2002 as compared with 2001 due to a decrease in the number of
employees.  Property taxes and licenses increased $2,273, 12.7%, in 2002 as
compared with 2001 due to an increase in property tax assessments.
Other expenses decreased $25,614, 41.5%, in 2002 as compared with 2001
primarily due to decreases in operating costs.

Income tax expense increased $6,300, 138.5%, in 2002 as compared with
2001 due to the increase in pre-tax income. The Company files a
consolidated federal income tax return with the Company's parent company
and other affiliates.

Transactions with the Company's parent company and its affiliates during
2002 and 2001 are disclosed in Note 4, Related Party Transactions, of the
Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company is considering acquisitions which would deplete the Company's
available cash and thus affect the liquidity of the Company.

                      	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Nature of Operations, Risks and Uncertainties

The Company is engaged in the ownership and rental of properties located
almost exclusively within Yellowstone County, Montana. The Company's rental
operations are dependent in large part upon the economy and rental conditions
within Yellowstone County, Montana. The Company leases its properties to
lessees under non-cancelable operating leases with terms of less than one
year.

The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of certain types of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled
transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

(b)	Depreciation

Depreciation for the various classifications of rental property, plant and
equipment is computed using the straight-line and accelerated methods over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings					15 - 27 Years
Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment	         3 - 10 Years

(c)	Income Taxes

differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting.

deposits, certificates of deposit and money market accounts, all with original
maturities of three months or less.

difference between the total net unrealized gain at December 31, 2002 and the
deferred income taxes applicable to the net unrealized gain.
