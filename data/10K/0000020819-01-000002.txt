LISTING OF DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE:
- ----------------------------------------------

(1) Part II-Items 5, 6, 7 and 8 - Annual Report to Shareholders for fiscal year
    ended December 31, 2000.

(2) Part III - Items 10-11, 12 and 13. Definitive proxy statement for the 2001

Item 1:

Business
- ----------------
The Registrant's operations are presently conducted through its Continuous Power
Systems located in Monrovia, California. The product presently being produced
consists of a line of uninterruptible power supplies (U.P.S.) ranging in size
from 500VA to 10 kVA. The U.P.S is a power system that can both smooth out
voltage fluctuations and maintain a power load under power blackout conditions.
U.P.S.'s are designed to provide fifteen minutes or more (depending on the
number of batteries) of support power to computers, scientific products, commu
nication systems, traffic signals or systems, or similar equipment should the
utility power fail. While the utility power is available, the U.P.S. provides
isolation from voltage or frequency transients which may disturb the systems
operations.

The Registrant markets the U.P.S line through trade publications, tradeshows and
telemarketing. However, sales are generally made by the Registrant through
distributors who sell the products to end-users. For the year ended 2000, Nova
Power Systems, a major distributor through its direct and indirect sales
accounted for approximately forty-nine percent of the Registrant's total sales

The Registrant assembles finished components and other materials to produce its
products. Relatively little fabrication or raw materials is done by the Regis-
trant. The Registrant purchases raw materials and finished components used in
production of the Registrant's products, some of which are imported. Thus, the
Registrant is dependent upon the ability of suppliers to meet performance speci-
fications, quality standards and delivery schedules. The Registrant endeavors
to assure availability of source of supplies and does not anticipate any
shortages which would adversely affect production schedules.

Competition:
- -----------
The markets for the Registrant's products are highly competitive. The Registrant
is aware of approximately thirty competitors for online UPS products. Many of
these companies have far greater financial resources than the Registrant.
The Registrant competes primarily on the basis of the quality, reliability and
technical sophistication of its products, although price remains an important
factor. The Registrant attempts to locate niche markets for UPS products where
greater reliablity is required by customers.

Substantially, all of the Registrant's products are the subject of on-going
modification and improvement and are subject to scientific and technological
changes.


Backlog
- -------
The following table sets forth the amounts representing orders believed by the
Registrant to be firm. The backlog at December 31,2000 represents orders which
the Registrant expects to deliver during 2001. There are no seasonal effects
on orders.
