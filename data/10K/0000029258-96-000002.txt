Diversified Realty, Inc. (herein referred to as "DRI" or the "Company") is a 
majority-owned subsidiary of M Corp, a financial holding company.  As of

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net income increased $13,392 (54.2%) in 1995 as compared with 1994.  The 
increase in net income in 1995 as compared with 1994 was due in part to an
increase in revenues and in part to a decrease in expenses.

Rent income increased $2,191 (3.0%) in 1995 as compared with 1994 due primarily
to a decrease in vacancies and an increase in rental rates.  Interest income
increased $3,235 (6.1%) in 1995 as compared with 1994.  The increase in interest
income in 1995 as compared with 1994 was due in part to an increase in interest-
bearing deposits and in part to an increase in rates earned on interest-bearing

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUED

in the amounts of $27,031 and $32,613 respectively.  Transactions with the 
Company's parent company and its affiliates during 1995 and 1994 are disclosed 
in Note 6, Related Party Transactions, of the Notes to Financial Statements.

Operating expenses in total, decreased $15,227 (17.1%) in 1995 as compared with 
1994.  Maintenance expenses decreased $6,452 (20.0%) in 1995 as compared with 
1994 due primarily to decreases in maintenance costs.  The provision for 
depreciation decreased $6,445 (23.5%) in 1995 as compared with 1994 due to some
of the Company's assets being fully depreciated during 1995 and 1994.

Income tax expense increased $6,948 (53.2%) in 1995 as compared with 1994 due to
the decrease in pre-tax income.  The Company files a consolidated income tax
return with the Company's parent company and other affiliated companies.

Although there are no present plans with respect thereto, the Company is 
involved in an ongoing basis in examining and investigating investment 
opportunities available to the Company which could possibly result in a 
change in the liquidity of the Company.  However, the Company knows of no
existing trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties not otherwise 
mentioned herein that could result in a material change in the Company's 
liquidity.  The Company knows of no material trends, favorable or unfavorable, 
in the Company's capital resources.

1.	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a)	Depreciation

Depreciation for the various classifications of rental property, plant and 
equipment is computed using the straight-line and accelerated methods over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings						                           15 - 27 Years
Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment	         3 - 10 Years

(b)	Earnings Per Share

The computation of earnings per share in the accompanying statements is based
on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year 
(1,875,000 shares, each year).

(c)	Income Taxes

The Company files a consolidated income tax return with its parent company.  
Income taxes are allocated to the Company based upon the ratio of the 
Company's pre-tax income to total consolidated pre-tax income.

(d)	Policy of Cash Equivalents

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents include time 
deposits, certificates of deposit and money market accounts, all with original 
maturities of three months or less.

(e)	Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts to 	make 
them comparable to the 1995 presentation.  These changes had no 	impact on 
previously reported results of operations or shareholders' 	equity.

2.	CONCENTRATED CASH BALANCES

The Company maintains accounts with various stock brokerage firms.  The 
accounts contain cash and securities.  Cash balances are insured up to 
$100,000 by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SIPC").  
At December 31, 1995, a cash balance totalling $494,328 was uninsured by the 
SIPC.

3.	INVESTMENT SECURITIES

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 
("SFAS 115"), "Accounting For Investments in Certain Debt and Equity 
Securities" effective January 1, 1994.  In accordance with SFAS No. 115, the 
Company has classified its investment as a trading security.

                                                   1995            1994

Fair Value and Carrying Value                  $       6       $        6 

The statements of income for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 
contain no net realized gains or losses on the disposition of investment 
securities.  The statements of income for the years ended December 31, 1995 
and 1994 do not include any provision for unrealized gains or losses.

4.   CONTRACT RECEIVABLE

Contract receivable at December 31 consists of the following:

                                                   1995              1994    
9% Contract For Deed, due in monthly
 installments of $248 including interest to
 September, 2002                               $  15,019          $  16,559

The above contract receivable is secured by real property, the sale of which

and the underlying collateral is completely worthless, the Company would 
incur a loss in the amount of the receivable.

5.	INCOME TAXES-Continued

The income tax expense reflected in the financial statements differs from the
amounts that would normally be expected by applying the U.S. Federal income 
tax rates to income before income taxes.  The reasons for these differences 
are as follows:

    						                                              1995         1994     

Computed "Expected" Tax Expense                      $  19,800   $   12,800

Other                                                      200          252     
                                                     $  20,000   $   13,052  

6.	RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

During 1995 and 1994 the Company received managerial assistance from its 
parent company at no cost to the Company.  In addition, the Company has had 
transactions with its parent company or subsidiaries of its parent company, 
as follows:




                                                        1995         1994   

Net Cash Transfers To Parent                         $    -     $    7,260 

Income Tax Allocation                                 (19,950)     (13,000)

Was Charged For Insurance                              (2,400)      (2,400)

Charged Interest To Parent                             27,031       32,613 




7. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating
its fair value disclosure for financial instruments. The carrying amounts
reported in the balance sheet for cash and the receivable from the Company's
parent company approximate those assets' fair value. Fair value for investment
securities is based on quoted market prices. The Company believes that the 
fair value of its contract receivable, which has a stated interest rate of 
9.0 %, approximates carrying value due to the credit risk involved.


8. NATURE OF OPERATIONS, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

The Company is engaged in the ownership and rental of properties located
primarily in Yellowstone County, Montana.

The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of certain types of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled
transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
