<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Item 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>Church Loans &amp; Investments Trust ("the Trust") is a real estate
investment  trust  organized under the laws of the State of Texas in March 1963.
Although  the Trust has the  authority  to engage  in the  business  of  buying,
selling and leasing of real  estate,  the Trust has  heretofore  restricted  its
business  activities  primarily to making loans to churches and other  nonprofit
organizations  and assisted living centers which are secured by a first mortgage
on real estate owned by such borrowers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>The  period of  duration  of the  Trust,  unless  dissolved  in
accordance  with law,  or by the  consent of the owners of shares of  beneficial
interest  in  the  Trust,  is  perpetual.  The  Trust  may be  dissolved  by the
affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the owners of outstanding shares
of the Trust.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>The control and  management of the Trust  properties,  and all
powers  necessary or appropriate to effect any and all of the purposes for which
the Trust is organized, is vested in the Board of Trust Managers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The number of shares of beneficial  interest in the Trust which
the Trust is authorized to issue is unlimited.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>The Trust is  qualified as a "real  estate  investment  trust"
under  Sections  856-858 of the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986 as amended (the
"Internal Revenue Code" or "Code"). It is the intention of the Trust to continue
to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>The Trust  maintains  an office  located  at 5305 I-40  West,
Amarillo, TX 79106 (telephone 806/358-3666).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>As  mentioned  above,  the Trust is  primarily  engaged in the
business of making mortgage loans to churches and other nonprofit  organizations
and assisted living centers.  The Declaration of Trust restricts the investments
of the Trust to loans secured by a first  mortgage,  deed of trust or other lien
covering  real  property  with the amount of such loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of
the value of the real  property  securing such loan as determined by a competent
independent appraiser.  Although the Trust has been primarily in the business of
making long-term mortgage loans,  during the past several years it has also been
actively involved in making short-term  interim or construction loans to finance
the  construction  of church  buildings,  the  construction  of assisted  living
centers,   the  purchase  of  real  estate,   or  the  refinancing  of  existing
indebtedness. Most of the interim loans presently</FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-4-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>being made by the Trust are associated  with bond offerings of
churches and other nonprofit  organizations  and assisted living centers.  These
interim  loans  are  scheduled  to be  repaid  from  the  proceeds  of the  bond
offerings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>The Trust is not  limited  to the  location  of the  property
securing any loans in which it may invest and seeks to spread its investments in
areas of the United States where favorable yields prevail.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>As of March 31, 2001,  the Trust has 96 permanent  and interim
mortgage  loans and  investments  in church bonds having a principal  balance of
$43,150,219,  with the average  principal  amount  thereof being  $449,481.  The
interest  rates on these  loans vary from 8% to 13% per annum with the  weighted
average  interest rate of mortgage loans and church bonds being 10.28% per annum
at March 31,  2001.  The  original  terms of these  loans  vary from one year to
thirty years, with the majority being for a term of twenty years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>During the fiscal year of the Trust ending March 31, 2001, the
net income of the Trust was  $2,628,232,  as  compared to  $3,059,815  in fiscal
2000,  a decrease of 14.10%.  The decrease in net income of the Trust was due to
several  factors,  including (a) a decrease in the Trust's net interest  income;
and (b) a decrease  in other  income of the Trust.  Net  interest  income of the
Trust  was lower in  fiscal  2001 as  compared  to  fiscal  2000 due to  several
reasons,  including: (a) extraordinary higher interest income in fiscal 2000 due
to the pay-off of a loan owing to the Trust that was previously characterized as
non-performing  resulting in the  recognition of additional  interest  income in
fiscal 2000 of approximately  $611,000,  and (b) an increase in interest expense
of the  Trust.  Other  income  for the  fiscal  year  ended  March 31,  2000 was
substantially  higher  than normal due to gains on the sale of other real estate
of $421,367 in fiscal 2000.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>The net income of the Trust for each of the  quarters  during
fiscal 2001 was as follows:  first  quarter-$605,885;  second  quarter-$982,352;
third quarter-$562,262; and fourth quarter- $494,798.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>The  operational  expense of the Trust decreased from $751,117
during fiscal 2000 to $731,524 in fiscal 2001.  The  operational  expense of the
Trust included general and  administrative  expenses and compensation to members
of the Board of Trust Managers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>During  fiscal  2001,  the Trust  advanced  loan  proceeds of
$30,618,186 on 39 different loans. Most, if not all, of such loans bear interest
at a variable rate varying from 1.5% to 2% per annum in excess of the prime rate
of interest  published by the Wall Street  Journal and known as the "Wall Street
Journal Prime."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>During fiscal 2001, the Trust employed a total of 5 full time
employees and employed, as needed, two additional part-time employees.</FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-5-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The business  conditions in which the Trust operates has become
more  competitive in the past fiscal year as more and more banks are re-entering
the business of making loans to churches,  especially the more  desirable,  less
risky, church loans. If this trend continues, the rates and fees which the trust
can charge may decrease.  However,  loan demand remains good as evidenced by the
number of loan requests received by the Trust and the number of loan commitments
outstanding as of March 31, 2001.</FONT></P>

<A NAME="DESCRIPTION_OF_PROPERTY"></A>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Item 2 - DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>The Trust  maintains as its only place of business its offices
located at 5305 I-40 West,  in Amarillo,  Texas.  Such  building is owned by the
Trust and is  occupied  solely by the  Trust.  There is no debt owed by Trust in
regard to its real property.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3> The real  properties  of the Trust,  net of  depreciation  and
excluding  real  estate  acquired  through  foreclosure,  are not a  significant
portion of the Trust's  assets,  representing  less than 1% of the Trust's total
assets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>As previously  mentioned,  the Trust's primary business is the
making of  mortgage  loans to churches  and other  nonprofit  organizations  and
assisted living  centers.  The Declaration of Trust restricts the investments of
the Trust to loans  secured by a first  mortgage,  deed of trust,  or other lien
covering  real  property  with the amount of such loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of
the value of the real property  securing such loan. The Declaration of Trust may
not be amended  without  the  affirmative  vote of  two-thirds  (2/3rds)  of the
Certificates  of  Beneficial  Interest  entitled  to  vote.  The  Board of Trust
Managers'  general  policy  is to limit  investment  of Trust  assets in any one
mortgage loan to not more than  $2,000,000.  However,  at the  discretion of the
Board of Trust Managers, the Trust may make and has made loans in excess of such
limit.  All such  investment  in  mortgage  loans is for the  purpose of earning
income for the Trust.</FONT></P>

OF OPERATION</FONT></H2>


<P><FONT SIZE=3>Results of Operations - 2001 compared to 2000</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, interest income and
fees of the Trust  increased by $197,451  (4.19%) over the previous fiscal year.
Such increase was primarily  attributable  to several  factors,  including (a) a
slight  increase in the average  interest  yield on the Trust's  loan and church
bond portfolio;  and (b) an increase in performing  mortgage loans, church bonds
and interim loans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The average interest rate on loans and church bonds held by the
Trust increased from 10.14% as of March 31, 2000 to 10.28% as of March 31, 2001.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>There was an increase in the amount of performing interim loans
held by the Trust from  $8,827,383  as of March 31,  2000 to  $11,537,684  as of
March 31, 2001 and there was an increase in performing mortgage loans during the
recent fiscal year from  $22,141,873  as of March 31, 2000 to  $25,537,346 as of
March 31, 2001. Therefore, the total performing mortgage loans, church bonds and
performing  interim loans held by the Trust  increased  from  $30,969,256  as of
March 31, 2000 to $37,075,030  as of March 31, 2001.  This increase is partially
the result of an increase in the  investment  in mortgage and interim loans made
by the Trust during fiscal 2001 of $30,618,186 as compared to $26,748,968 during
fiscal 2000. This  represents an increase of $3,869,218 or 14.46%.  The increase
in the investment by the Trust in mortgage loans also contributed to an increase
of $36,285 in commitment  fees earned by the Trust in fiscal 2001 as compared to
fiscal 2000. The increase in performing mortgage loans, church bonds and interim
loans was also caused by a decrease  in the  payments  received on mortgage  and
interim construction loans and church bonds from $26,342,866 for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2000 to $24,866,228 during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>The net  income of the Trust for fiscal  2001 was  $2,628,232
($.38 per share), a decrease of $431,583 (14.10%) from the previous fiscal year.
Such decrease was primarily  attributable  to various  factors,  including (a) a
decrease in the Trust's net interest income;  and (b) a decrease in other income
of the Trust.  Net interest  income  decreased from $3,594,736 in fiscal 2000 to
$3,344,074 in fiscal 2001, a decrease of $250,662 (7.0%) from fiscal 2000. Other
income for the fiscal year ended March 31,  2000 was  substantially  higher than
normal due to gains on the sale of other real estate of $421,367 in fiscal 2000.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>The  interest  income of the Trust for the fiscal  year ended
March 31, 2000 was  significantly  influenced  by the payment of a loan owing to
the Trust that was previously characterized</FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-8-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>as  non-performing.  The  pay-off of this loan  resulted in an
additional  recognition of interest income of  approximately  $611,000 in fiscal
2000.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The decrease in the net income of the Trust for fiscal 2001 was
also attributable to an increase in the interest expense of the Trust. In fiscal
2001, the average aggregate amount of total debt outstanding was $4,120,873 more
than in fiscal 2000. The interest expense of the Trust increased from $1,110,202
for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000 to $1,568,994 for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2001, an increase of $458,792 or 41.33%. The average month-end balance
of the indebtedness owing by the Trust increased from $14,733,497 for the fiscal
year ended  March 31,  2000 to  $18,854,370  for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2001.  Such  increase was due to an increase in the debt of the Trust  resulting
from the increase in the Trust's investment in mortgages and interim loans. Such
increase  was somewhat  offset by a decrease in the Trust's  cost of funds.  The
approximate weighted average annual interest rate upon the aggregate outstanding
debt  decreased  from  8.00%  at the end of  fiscal  2000 to 7.00% at the end of
fiscal 2001.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>Income  from the  realization  of loan  discounts  from  loan
purchases  also  decreased  from  $125,022  for the year ended March 31, 2000 to
$42,033 for the year ended March 31, 2001, a decrease of $82,989.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>General and  administrative  expenses  of the Trust  slightly
decreased from $695,719 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000 to $676,149 for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, a decrease of $19,570 or 2.81%.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>Dividends  related to fiscal 2001 were $2,870,331 or $.41 per
share.  Dividends  are based on  taxable  income  which  varies  from net income
reported  in  the  financial   statements   because  of  temporary   differences
(differences  between the tax basis of an asset or  liability  and its  reported
amount in the  financial  statements  that will result in taxable or  deductible
amounts  in future  years).  Future  dividends  may be more or less than the net
income  reported  in the  financial  statements  because of  variances  in these
temporary differences.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>During fiscal 2001,  the prime  interest rate  decreased from
9.00% to 8.00%.  Should the prime interest rate decrease during fiscal 2002, the
interest expense of the Trust will generally  decrease and the net income of the
Trust will, in turn, generally increase. Should the prime interest rate increase
during fiscal 2002, the interest  expense of the Trust will  generally  increase
and the net income of the Trust will, in turn, generally decrease.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Payments  received on the interim and permanent loan portfolio
and the church bonds held by the Trust decreased from $26,342,866  during fiscal
2000 to $24,866,228  during fiscal 2001, a decrease of 5.61%.  This decrease was
primarily attributable to the decrease in interim loans made by the Trust during
the  year  ended  March  31,  2000.  If the  Trust  had made  additional  loans,
especially interim loans during the year ended March 31, 2000, then</FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-9-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>the normal  maturity  of those  loans  would have  resulted in
additional  payments on such loans being received in the fiscal year ended March
31, 2001.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>During  fiscal  2001 the  Trust  sold  properties  which it had
previously  received through  foreclosure.  Gain on the sale of these properties
was  $180,662  for fiscal 2001 as  compared  to gain of the sales of  foreclosed
properties in fiscal 2000 of $421,367.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>Liquidity and Capital Resources</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>  The Trust is  engaged  primarily  in the  business  of making
permanent and interim loans to churches and other non-profit organizations,  and
to other borrowers,  including  businesses engaged in the building and operation
of assisted  living  centers.  At March 31, 2001, the Trust had six loans to two
different  borrowers  which are secured by assisted living centers which totaled
approximately  $13,105,000.  Three of these loans were to  affiliated  borrowers
totaling approximately  $4,268,875 and with the remaining three loans to another
borrower totaling $8,836,125.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>  The  assets  of the  Trust  primarily  consist  of  its  loan
portfolio,  real estate acquired through foreclosure and its office building and
facilities. The operational expense of the Trust is comprised of the maintenance
of its office  building,  the  payment of the  salaries  of its  management  and
support staff,  office expenses,  fees paid to the Board of Trust Managers,  and
the payment for legal and accounting  services.  Substantially  all of the Trust
assets are invested in the permanent  and interim  loans made by the Trust.  The
only  potential  liquidity  problems  of the Trust are related to the timely and
proper  repayment  by the Trust of the  leveraged  funds it has borrowed to make
loans in excess of its capital and the  ability to fund loan  commitments  which
totaled  $4,803,990 at March 31, 2001. All of the  indebtedness  of the Trust is
generally classified as short term having maturities ranging from "on demand" to
maturities repayable over various periods extending through fiscal 2002.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3> All of the debt  obligations  of the Trust  outstanding  as of
March 31, 2001 in the amount of $20,675,801  shall mature in fiscal 2002.  These
debt obligations primarily consist of the Trust's bank line of credit and Master
Note  Agreements.  Although  the Trust's  bank line of credit  matures in fiscal
2002, it is anticipated that the line of credit will be renewed annually. In the
event that the bank elects not to renew the line of credit,  the Trust may under
the terms of the loan agreement retire the line of credit over a period of time,
not to exceed five years,  equal to the weighted  average  remaining term of all
real estate lien notes of the Trust which are pledged to secure the bank line of
credit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>  Previously,  the Trust issued  Secured  Savings  Certificates
('Certificates').  However, all of the Certificates  outstanding as of March 31,
2000 in the amount of  $726,000  were paid as and when  matured  during the 2001
fiscal year.</FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-10-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>  At March  31,  2001  loans to the  Trust  under  Master  Note
Agreements,  which are in effect demand notes, total  $13,015,801.  In the past,
the Trust has utilized its bank line of credit, principal paid to the Trust upon
its  outstanding  loan  portfolio,  and the proceeds  received  from the sale of
Certificates in order to meet its maturing obligations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3> At March 31, 2001,  the balance which could be borrowed by the
Trust  upon its bank line of credit  was $  7,340,000.  The  principal  payments
scheduled  to be  received  by the Trust upon its loan  portfolio  for the years
ending March 31, 2002 and 2003 are  $16,814,534  and  $1,266,320,  respectively.
Assuming all of these scheduled principal payments are received, these payments,
together with the balance  available to Church Loans on its bank line of credit,
would  allow  Church  Loans  to  have  sufficient  funds  to meet  its  maturing
obligations  and fund loan  commitments  without the  necessity for Church Loans
having to sell any additional Certificates or borrow funds from other sources.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3> Due to the cost of registration and the other costs of sales of
Certificates,  the cost of these  funds  are  normally  higher  than the cost of
borrowing from bank sources or master notes.  Therefore,  the Trust discontinued
the registration of Certificates and ceased the sales of Certificates as of July
16,  1997.  The Trust also  obtained an increase in its bank line of credit from
$10,000,000 to $15,000,000  effective  September 1, 1997. Based upon the success
of the Trust to obtain  borrowings  in the past,  the Trust is  confident  that,
should it be  necessary,  it will be able to register and sell  Certificates  or
obtain  additional  bank  financing in the future in sufficient  amounts for the
Trust to timely meet all of its obligations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3> Should all the scheduled  principal payments upon loans made by
the Trust not be received,  and should the Trust be unable to borrow against its
line of credit,  and should  borrowings from other sources not be available,  it
would  be  necessary  for the  Trust  to sell a  portion  of its  mortgage  loan
portfolio in order for it to meet all of its financial obligations. At March 31,
2001,  the principal  balance of the loan and church bond portfolio of the Trust
was  $42,730,905.  The weighted  average interest rate on loans and church bonds
was 10.28% per annum. In view of the normal marketability of conventional loans,
the Trust would  probably be  required to discount  the great  majority of these
loans in order for them to be attractive for purchase.  The principal  amount of
these loans if discounted to yield a weighted  average interest rate of 12%, 14%
and 16% would be $36,606,142, $31,376,693, and $27,454,606,  respectively. There
is no  assurance  that the Trust would be able to sell all, or a portion of, its
portfolio  of loans,  in which  event,  it would be  necessary  for the Trust to
secure a loan,  or  loans,  from a lender  in  order  for the  Trust to meet its
financial  obligations.  There is no  assurance  that the Trust would be able to
secure a loan in such instance.  The Trust has sold only one of the loans in its
mortgage  loan  portfolio  and,  therefore,   has  limited  experience  in  this
area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3> Principal  payments  scheduled to be received by the Trust upon
its permanent loan portfolio during the years ending March 31, 2002 and 2003, if
not used to fund new loan  commitments,  would be used to reduce the outstanding
indebtedness of the Trust. Should</FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-11-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<P><FONT SIZE=3> the Trust use the payments of principal which shall be received
upon its loan  portfolio to reduce its  outstanding  indebtedness,  the interest
expense of the Trust will decrease.  In such  instance,  whether the decrease in
the interest  income will exceed,  or be less than, the decrease in the interest
expense will largely be dependent upon the prime rate of interest  prevailing at
such time due to the fact that the  interest  to be earned by the Trust upon its
mortgage  loan  portfolio is generally  based upon a fixed rate of interest or a
variable rate of interest that periodically  reprices,  while the interest to be
paid by the Trust upon its outstanding debts is directly, or indirectly, tied to
the prime rate of interest charged by major domestic banks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3> As of March 31, 2001, a substantial  portion of the promissory
notes  evidencing  the loans made by the Trust  have been  pledged to secure the
Trust's bank line of credit.  Promissory notes totaling $14,737,863 were pledged
against  the bank  line of  credit  which  had a total  outstanding  balance  of
$7,660,000.  The required collateral for this bank loan was $8,426,000,  leaving
an excess of promissory  notes which have been pledged to secure said bank notes
of $6,311,863.  These excess  promissory  notes may be reassigned by the bank to
the Trust to be sold in order for the Trust to meet its  financial  obligations.
Should  it  be  necessary,  in  order  for  the  Trust  to  meet  its  financial
obligations,  these excess notes  amounting to $6,311,863  and other  additional
promissory notes in the approximate amount of $27,674,742 (for a total amount of
$33,986,605)  would be available  to be sold by the Trust to meet its  financial
obligations.  Should the excess  promissory notes be assigned by the bank to the
Trust as  heretofore  described,  the bank line of credit  would  continue to be
secured by the required  ratio of notes pledged to the principal  balance of the
bank line of credit.  There is no assurance that the Trust would be able to sell
all, or any portion of, these notes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3> Cash flows from operating  activities consists primarily of net
income.  The primary  components of net income are interest  income and expense.
Interest  income  should  continue  to be the main  source of cash  provided  by
operating  activities;  however, the availability of this cash flow is dependent
upon the ability of the borrowers to repay loans. In fact,  there was a decrease
in the amount of non-performing loans as of March 31, 2001 compared to March 31,
2000.  Accordingly,  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  has  been and is
expected to be a relatively stable source of cash flow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3> Cash flows from investing  activities  results  primarily from
investment in and payments received on mortgage and interim  construction  loans
and church bonds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3> Cash flows from financing  activities  relate primarily to the
borrowings and payments on notes payable and the line of credit.  Borrowings are
made as funds are  needed to make loans or as current  obligations  become  due.
Based upon the success of the Trust to obtain  borrowings in the past, the Trust
is  confident  that  it  will be able to  obtain  borrowings  in the  future  in
sufficient amounts,  along with payments to be received on loans, to timely meet
its  obligations.  Furthermore,  the Trust is  confident  that if it  decides to
register additional</FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-12-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>  Certificates in the future,  it would have similar success in
selling the Certificates as it has had in the past.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3> Inflation</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3> At March 31, 2001, the weighted  average  interest rate on the
mortgage loan and church bond  portfolio of the Trust was 10.28% per annum while
the weighted  average  interest rate upon all  borrowings of the Trust was 7.00%
per annum.  Although a majority of the loans  constituting the loan portfolio of
the Trust have been made at variable  rates of interest that  generally  reprice
either  daily,  annually,  or  otherwise  periodically,  a portion  of the loans
constituting  the  Trust's  loan  portfolio  have  been  made at fixed  rates of
interest and  therefore are not subject to being  increased or decreased  during
the term of the loan. All of the indebtedness of the Trust is either directly or
indirectly  tied  to the  prime  rate  of  interest  charged  by  major  banking
institutions  and,  therefore,  is subject  to  fluctuation.  During  periods of
inflation, the prime rate of interest charged by major banking institutions,  as
well as the interest rate or cost of borrowing money from any lender,  generally
increases.  Consequently,  during an inflationary period the interest expense of
the Trust  would  increase.  Since the  interest  income of the Trust  would not
increase as rapidly,  an  increase  in the  interest  expense of the Trust would
decrease  the  net  income  of  the  Trust.  However,   interest  income  should
subsequently  increase as variable rate loans reprice.  Should the amount of the
loans and the  amount of the  indebtedness  of the Trust  remain  constant,  and
should the weighted  average  interest  rate upon the  indebtedness  increase to
approximately  21.25% per annum, the interest income and the interest expense of
the Trust would be substantially equal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3> New Accounting Standards</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3> In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (FASB)
issued  Statement No. 133,  Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging
Activities,  which  addresses the  accounting for  derivative  transactions  and
hedging   activities.   Subsequently,   FASB  issued  statement  No.  137  which
effectively  delayed  adoption of No. 133 by one year.  The Trust will adopt the
new  standard  beginning  with its 2002  fiscal  year,  when  adoption  is first
required.  Management  has evaluated the reporting  requirements  under this new
standard  and  believes  it will  not  have a  material  impact  on the  Trust's
financial results.</FONT></P>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>The Board of Trust Managers and Shareholders<BR>
Church Loans &amp; Investments Trust<BR>
Amarillo, Texas</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>We have audited the accompanying  balance sheets of Church Loans
&amp; Investments  Trust (a real estate  investment  trust) as of March 31, 2001 and
2000, and the related statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows
for the years then ended.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>We  conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted
auditing  standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>In  our opinion,  the  financial  statements  referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Church Loans
&amp;  Investments  Trust as of  March 31,  2001 and 2000,  and the  results  of its
operations  and its cash  flows  for the years  then  ended in  conformity  with
generally accepted accounting principles.</FONT></P>

<H4>NATURE OF OPERATIONS</H4>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>Church  Loans &amp;  Investments Trust (Church Loans) is a real
estate   investment  trust  that  invests  primarily  in  mortgage  and  interim
construction  loans to  churches  and other  borrowers  (see note 1) across  the
United States, particularly in the southern portion of the United States. Church
Loans requires that real estate  properties be pledged against loans as security
which could be foreclosed by Church Loans should the borrower default. Repayment
of  each  borrower's  obligations  is  generally  expected  to  be  repaid  from
contributions from church members or from operations of the borrower,  or in the
case  of  interim   construction  loans,  by  permanent  financing  provided  by
others.</FONT></P>

<H4>USE OF ESTIMATES</H4>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>The  preparation  of financial  statements in  conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</FONT></P>

<H4>CURRENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Church Loans has historically invested in long-term,  fixed-rate
mortgage loans,  generally funded by relatively  short-term debt obligations and
secured  savings  certificates  (SSCs).  The  volatility  of interest  rates and
increased  competition  to attract  customers'  funds have caused  Church Loans'
liability  structure  to become  short-term  and rate  sensitive.  Church  Loans
reflected an average  interest yield on its loan and church bond  portfolio,  an
average  interest rate on its total  indebtedness and a net interest rate margin
at March 31, 2001 and 2000 as follows:</FONT></P>

<H4>CHURCH BONDS</H4>

<P>Church bonds,  secured by first  mortgage  liens on church  facilities,  are stated at cost, as there is no traded market for the bonds
and management intends to hold such securities until maturity.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CHURCH LOANS &amp; INVESTMENTS TRUST<br>
(A Real Estate Investment Trust)<br>
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies<br>
March 31, 2001 and 2000</H4>

<H4>LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR POSSIBLE CREDIT LOSSES</H4>

<P>Loans are stated at the amount of unpaid  principal,  reduced by  unamortized
purchase discounts and the allowance for possible credit losses. Interest income
is recognized when earned.</P>

<P>A loan is considered  impaired when, based on current information and events,
it is  probable  that  Church  Loans  will be unable to  collect  the  scheduled
payments of principal and interest when due according to the  contractual  terms
of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's  effective  interest rate or
the market price or the fair value of the  collateral  if the loan is collateral
dependent.  The accrual of interest is generally  discontinued on mortgage loans
and church  bonds more than 90 days past due (180 days for interim  construction
loans) or when there is sufficient doubt as to the collection of interest.  When
interest accrual is discontinued,  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Cash
interest payments received are applied to principal when collection of principal
is in doubt or are  recognized as interest  income when recovery of principal is
reasonably assured.</P>

<P>The  allowance for possible credit losses is established  through a provision
for  possible  credit  losses  charged to  expense.  Loans and church  bonds are
charged against the allowance when  collectibility of the principal is unlikely.
Recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance.  The
charge to operations is based on  management's  and the board of trust managers'
evaluation of the loan and church bond portfolio,  including such factors as the
security  collateralizing the loans or church bonds, past credit loss experience
and general economic  conditions.  The allowance is subjective in nature and may
be  adjusted  in the near term  because of changes in the  borrower's  financial
status or economic conditions.</P>

<P>Commitment  fees received on interim  construction  loans are recognized over
the interim  commitment  period for loans that are not  permanently  financed by
Church  Loans  and  over  the  life of the  mortgage  loan  for  loans  that are
permanently  financed by Church  Loans.  Amounts are being  amortized  using the
straight-line  method. This method was not materially  different from the method
of deferring  commitment  fees until the commitment is exercised and recognizing
such fees as an  adjustment  to yield by the  interest  method  over the related
loans' lives as prescribed by generally accepted  accounting  principles for the
years ended March 31, 2001 and 2000. </P>

<P>Purchase discounts on loans are amortized based on the interest method.</P>

<H4>PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT</H4>

<P>Property  and equipment are stated at cost,  less  accumulated  depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on the  straight-line  method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets.</P>

<H4>REAL ESTATE ACQUIRED THROUGH FORECLOSURE</H4>

<P>Real estate acquired  through,  or in lieu of, loan foreclosure is to be sold
and is  initially  recorded  at  estimated  fair  value  at date of  foreclosure
establishing a new cost basis. Other real estate owned,  after  foreclosure,  is
carried at the lower of carrying  amount or the property's  estimated fair value
minus estimated costs to sell (fair value). Declines in the estimated fair value
below cost are recognized as a valuation allowance.  If the estimated fair value
subsequently  increases  above its carrying  value,  the valuation  allowance is
reduced,  but not below zero.  Increases or decreases in the valuation allowance
are charged or credited to operations.</P>

<P>The  valuation of other real estate owned is  subjective in nature and may be
adjusted  in the near term  because of changes in economic  conditions  or other
factors.</P>

<H4>INCOME TAXES</H4>

<P>Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  for the  future tax
consequences   attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial  statement
carrying  amounts of existing assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax
bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected  to apply to  taxable  income  in the  years in which  those  temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax
assets and  liabilities  of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.</P>

<H4>OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</H4>

<P>In  the  ordinary   course  of  business,   Church  Loans  has  entered  into
off-balance-sheet  financial  instruments  consisting of  commitments  to extend
credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when
they become payable.</P>

<H4>CASH FLOWS</H4>

<P>For  purposes of  reporting  cash flows,  cash and cash  equivalents  include
cash-on-hand  and investment in a money market mutual fund and  certificates  of
deposit with maturities of less than 90 days at the time of acquisition.</P>


<H4>NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD</H4>

<P>In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued Statement No.
133,  Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities,  which
addresses the  accounting for derivative  transactions  and hedging  activities.
Church  Loans will adopt the new standard  beginning  with its 2002 fiscal year,
the year in which  adoption is first  required.  Management  has  evaluated  the
impact of adopting  this new  standard  and believes it will not have a material
impact.</P>

<H4>NOTE 1 - LOANS AND CHURCH BONDS</H4>

<P>Mortgage  loans receivable  consist of conventional  loans of $26,210,414 and
$23,504,519  and church bonds of $737,614  and  $389,511 at  March 31,  2001 and
2000, respectively. Interim construction loans of $16,202,191 and $13,504,230 at
March 31, 2001 and 2000,  respectively,  consist  primarily of loans to churches
for the construction of church facilities and assisted living centers.  Mortgage
loans,  church bonds and interim  construction  loans are  generally  secured by
first liens on real estate  comprised  primarily of church  buildings  and other
real  estate.  The  amount of a loan is  generally  limited  to  66-2/3%  of the
appraised  value of the  related  property.  Certain  loans  are  guaranteed  by
individual  members of the  congregations or other individuals or congregations,
depending on the circumstances.</P>

<P>Church Loans'  portfolio  included  mortgage loans,  church bonds and interim
construction loans with interest rates ranging from 8% to 13% at March 31, 2001.
The weighted average annual interest rates of Church Loans' loan and church bond
portfolio were 10.28% and 10.14% at March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.</P>

<P>Generally  accepted  accounting  principles require disclosure of information
about  certain  concen-trations.  In  addition  to a  concentration  of loans to
churches,  Church Loans makes certain interim real estate construction loans and
permanent loans to entities other than churches. At March 31, 2001, Church Loans
had six loans to two borrowers which were secured by assisted living centers and
totaled  approximately  $13,105,000.  At March 31, 2000,  Church Loans had seven
such loans to two borrowers totaling approximately $12,483,000.</P>

<H4>NOTE 2 - DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CONTINUED)</H4>

<P>Descriptions of the various categories of debt obligations follow:</P>

<H4>Secured Savings Certificates</H4>

<P>SSCs were issued in amounts of $1,000 or more and have single  maturity dates
from 30 days to 10 years  from  date of issue.  With  respect  to an  individual
certificate, interest rate and frequency of payment of interest (either monthly,
quarterly,  semiannually,  annually  or at  maturity)  are  fixed at the time of
issuance of the certificate.  Effective July 1997, Church Loans discontinued the
sale of SSCs. At March 30, 2001, Church Loans had no SCCs outstanding.</P>

<H4>Line of Credit Payable to Bank</H4>

<P>The  line of credit  payable  to bank  consists  of  borrowings  under a loan
agreement effective through  December 30,  2001, that provides for a $15,000,000
line of credit with certain  commitment fees. The loan agreement requires Church
Loans to pledge mortgage loans receivable having unpaid principal  balances with
an  aggregate  present  value,  discounted  at 2% over the prime rate  (10.0% at
March 31,  2001),  of not less than 110% of all  indebtedness  owed to the bank.
Interest  accrued  at the prime  rate  less one  percent  during  2001 and 2000.
Interest is payable semiannually.</P>

<P>Additionally,  the line of credit requires that Church Loans' net worth be no
less than  $18,000,000 and its total  indebtedness  shall not exceed 150% of its
net worth. At March 31, 2001, Church Loans' total indebtedness was approximately
$11,000,000 less than the maximum amount permitted under the agreement.</P>

<H4>Demand Notes Payable</H4>

<P>The demand notes  payable bear  interest at 1% less than the prime rate (payable
monthly) and are unsecured (see note 6).</P>

<H4>NOTE 3 - INCOME TAX PROVISION</H4>

<P>Church Loans has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a real estate  investment
trust under the Code, Church Loans must, among other things, distribute at least
95% of its taxable income to its shareholders through dividends. Church Loans is
required to pay  dividends  of at least 85% of its calendar  year  undistributed
income by February 1 or be subject to a special  federal excise tax of 4% on the
undistributed amount.</P>

<H4>NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS</H4>

<P>Church Loans is a party to financial instruments with  off-balance-sheet risk
in the normal course of business. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to
lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established
in the contract.  Commitments  generally  have variable  interest  rates,  fixed
expiration  dates or other  termination  clauses and  require  payment of a fee.
Since some of the  commitments  may expire  without being drawn upon,  the total
commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Church
Loans  evaluates each  customer's  credit  worthiness on a  case-by-case  basis.
Collateral  generally  includes real estate  properties.  The exposure to credit
loss in the event of  nonperformance  by the other party to the  commitments  to
extend  credit is  represented  by the  contractual  amount.  At March 31, 2001,
Church  Loans  had  outstanding  loan  commitments  (by  contract   amounts)  of
approximately $4,803,990.  Management does not anticipate any losses as a result
of these transactions.</P>

<H4>NOTE 9 - DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</H4>

<P>The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial  instruments,  the results of applying  such methods and
assumptions to the financial  instruments and limitations inherent in fair value
estimates:</P>

<H4>Cash and Cash Equivalents</H4>

<P>The  assets are  considered  short-term  instruments  for which the  carrying
amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.</P>

<H4>Loans and Church Bonds</H4>

<P>Fair  values are  estimated for  portfolios  of loans with similar  financial
characteristics.  Loans are  segregated  by type,  such as mortgage  and interim
construction  loans and church bonds.  Each loan  category is further  segmented
into  fixed  and  adjustable  rate  interest  terms.  For  variable-rate  loans,
primarily  interim  construction  loans,  that  reprice  frequently  and with no
significant  change in credit risk,  fair values are based on carrying  amounts.
The fair value of fixed-rate  mortgage loans and bonds is generally estimated by
discounting  the future cash flows  through  the  estimated  maturity  using the
current  rates at which  similar  loans would be made to borrowers  with similar
credit  ratings.  The estimate of maturity is based on Church Loans'  historical
experience with repayments for each loan classification,  modified, as required,
by an estimate of the effect of current  economic  and lending  conditions.  The
carrying  value of loans,  net of the allowance for loan losses was  $41,162,733
and  $35,548,741 and the fair value of loans was  approximately  $41,700,000 and
$34,800,000 at March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.</P>

<H4>Notes Payable and Line of Credit</H4>

<P>The  fair  value of notes  payable  and the line of  credit  are equal to the
carrying value as such liabilities are deemed to be short-term borrowings.</P>

<H4>Secured Savings Certificates</H4>

<P>The fair value of secured  savings  certificates is estimated using the rates
currently  offered for financial  instruments  of similar  characteristics.  The
carrying  value of secured  savings  certificates  was $-0- and $726,000 and the
fair value of secured savings  certificates was approximately  $-0- and $729,000
at March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.</P>

<H4>Commitments to Extend Credit</H4>

<P>Generally,   Church  Loans  enters  into  commitments  to  extend  credit  at
adjustable  interest terms.  Accordingly,  the commitment amount is a reasonable
estimate of fair value.</P>

<H4>Other</H4>

<P>The carrying  amounts of notes  receivable and accrued  interest  approximate
fair value.</P>

<H4>NOTE 9 - DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)</H4>

<H4>Limitations</H4>

<P>Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time,  based on relevant
market  information  and  information  about  the  financial  instrument.  These
estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering
for sale at one time Church  Loans'  entire  holdings of a particular  financial
instrument.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of Church Loans'
financial  instruments,  fair value  estimates are based on judgments  regarding
future   expected   loss   experience,   current   economic   conditions,   risk
characteristics  of various  financial  instruments,  and other  factors.  These
estimates  are  subjective  in nature and involve  uncertainties  and matters of
significant  judgment  and,  therefore,  cannot be  determined  with  precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.</P>
