DESCRIPTION AND LINES OF BUSINESS


Diversified Realty, Inc. (herein referred to as "DRI" or the "Company") is a
majority-owned subsidiary of M Corp, a financial holding company.  As of
December 31, 2000, M Corp owned approximately ninety-four percent of the
outstanding common stock of the Company.

The Company is primarily engaged in the ownership and rental of real
property.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Income decreased $18,406, 18.8%, in 2000 as compared with 1999. The
decrease in net income in 2000 as compared with 1999 was due primarily to a
gain realized on the sale of property during 1999. No such gains were
realized during 2000.

Rent income decreased $6,762, 8.7%, in 2000 as compared with 1999
primarily because of the 1999 sale of one of the Company's units.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUED

Interest income increased $30,026, 30.3%, in 2000 as compared with 1999. The
increase in interest income in 2000 as compared with 1999 was due to an
increase in interest-bearing deposits and an increase in rates earned by the
Company.

Total operating expenses increased $5,698, 8.1%, in 2000 as compared with
1999. Salaries and payroll costs increased $4,025, 389.6%, in 2000 as
compared with 1999 due to an increase in the number of employees. Property
taxes and licenses decreased $982, 6.0%, in 2000 as compared with 1999 due
primarily to the 1999 sale of one of the Company's units. Other expenses
increased $3,031, 7.8%, in 2000 as compared with 1999 due to increases in
operating  costs.

Income tax expense decreased $12,200, 20.0%, in 2000 as compared with 1999
due to the decrease in pre-tax income. The Company files a consolidated
federal income tax return with the Company's parent company and other
affiliates.

Transactions with the Company's parent company and its affiliates during
2000 and 1999 are disclosed in Note 4, Related Party Transactions, of the
Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company is considering acquisitions that would deplete the Company's
available cash and thus affect the liquidity of the Company.

                      	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Nature of Operations, Risks and Uncertainties

The Company is engaged in the ownership and rental of properties located
almost exclusively within Yellowstone County, Montana. The Company's rental
operations are dependent in large part upon the economy and rental conditions
within Yellowstone County, Montana. The Company leases its properties to
lessees under non-cancelable operating leases with terms of less than one
year.

The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of certain types of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled
transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

(b)	Depreciation

Depreciation for the various classifications of rental property, plant and
equipment is computed using the straight-line and accelerated methods over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings						                           15 - 27 Years
Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment	         3 - 10 Years

(c)	Income Taxes

The Company files a consolidated income tax return with its parent company.
Income taxes are allocated to the Company based upon the ratio of the
Company's pre-tax income to total consolidated pre-tax income.

(d)	Policy of Cash Equivalents

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents include time
deposits, certificates of deposit and money market accounts, all with original
maturities of three months or less.

(e) Comprehensive Income

There were no items of other comprehensive income in 2000 or 1999, and net
income is therefore equal to comprehensive income for each of those years.

1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -(continued)

(f) Retirement Plans

The Company adopted an employees' savings plan under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") during 1998. The Company allows eligible
employees to contribute the maximum percentage of their compensation allowed
by the Code. The Company matches employee contributions in an amount equal
to fifty percent of the first six percent of the employee's compensation
up to a maximum of $1,080. Participants are at all times fully vested
in their contributions and are gradually vested in the Company's
contributions. The Company's 401(k) contributions and administrative costs
were $0 for 2000 and 1999.

(g) Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts to make
them comparable to the 2000 presentation. These changes had no	impact on
previously reported results of operations or shareholders'	equity.


2.CASH BALANCES

The Company maintains cash accounts with various financial institutions
and stock brokerage firms. Cash balances are insured up to $100,000 by
either the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SIPC") or the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). At December 31, 2000, cash
balances totaling $1,978,657 were uninsured by either the SIPC or the FDIC.

3.	INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense consists of the following, all currently payable:

                                                     2000           1999

U.S. Income Taxes                                $  42,000      $  51,000

3.INCOME TAXES - (continued)

The income tax expense reflected in the financial statements differs from
the amounts that would normally be expected by applying the U.S. Federal
income tax rates to income before income taxes. The reasons for these
differences are as follows:

 						                                              2000           1999

4.	RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

During 2000 and 1999 the Company received managerial assistance from M Corp,
its parent company, at no cost to the Company. The Company owns ten of the
thirty-four condominium units of the Cedar Grove Condominiums located in
Billings, Montana. The Company paid assessments to the Cedar Grove
Condominium Association, Inc. during 2000 and 1999 in the amounts of $12,540
