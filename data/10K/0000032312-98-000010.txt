                   Independent Auditors' Report



Board of Directors
EMCEE Broadcast Products, Inc.
White Haven, Pennsylvania

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of EMCEE Broadcast Products,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1998 and 1997 and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the
years then ended.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EMCEE
Broadcast Products, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1998 and 1997, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 1998 AND 1997
                                 
1.  Summary of significant accounting policies:

Principles of consolidation:
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EMCEE Broadcast
Products, Inc. and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned (together,
the Company).  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated.

Revenue recognition, sale of license:
During 1992, a rural cellular license was sold for $3,100,000.  The initial
payment was $845,000, net of closing costs of $155,000.  The $2,100,000
balance, which bore interest at 7% payable at maturity, was due in December
1996.  None of the deferred payment and the related interest income was
recognized prior to 1997 because of their extended collection period and
because there was not a reasonable basis to evaluate the likelihood of
collection.  On April 3, 1997 the Company collected $2,500,000 and received a
non-interest bearing, unsecured $500,000 note receivable as settlement of the
original note. The $500,000 note receivable is due and payable upon the
occurrence of any one or more of certain specified events involving the debtor
including, but not limited to, acquisition, merger, bankruptcy, and
insolvency.  None of the specified events relate to the debtor's normal
operations.  The note receivable is fully reserved because it has no definite
collection period and because there is not a reasonable basis to evaluate the
likelihood of collection.

Cash, equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills:
The Company considers cash equivalents to be all highly liquid investments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.  U.S. Treasury
Bills with an original maturity of more than three months are considered to be
investments.  All U.S. Treasury Bills are stated at cost which approximates
market and are considered as available for sale.  All U.S. Treasury Bills  not
included as cash equivalents had contracted maturities of at least six months.

Inventories:
Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates
current actual cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market (net realizable
value).

Property, plant and equipment and depreciation:
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is provided on
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
    
Advertising:
These expenses are recorded when incurred.  They amounted to $78,000 and
$75,000 for 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Fair value:
The fair value of long-term debt that is variable rate debt that reprices
regularly, the notes receivable of $2,500,000 which were collected in April

<PAGE>
1997 and U.S. Treasury Bills approximates the amounts recorded in the
financial statements.  It was not practicable to estimate the fair value of
the $500,000 note receivable  because the Company was unable to estimate the
timing and form of the ultimate settlement of the amount due to it.  The
Company has fully provided for any potential loss resulting from the
non-payment of this receivable.
Use of estimates:
Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements. 
Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the
reported revenues and expenses.

Reclassifications:
Certain amounts reported in the 1997 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the 1998 presentation.
2. Income per share:

Basic income per share is computed by dividing earnings applicable to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. 
Diluted income per share  is similar to basic income per share except that the
weighted average of common shares outstanding is increased to include the
number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the
dilutive potential common shares had been issued.  There were no dilutive
potential common shares in 1998 because the assumed exercise of the options
would be anti-dilutive.  Income per share for 1997 has been restated based
upon the provisions of a revised accounting standard that become effective in
the current year.
The following table presents the basic and diluted EPS computations:

6.  Line of credit:

The Company has a line of credit agreement with a bank aggregating $2,000,000
collateralized by inventories, accounts receivable and all property, plant and
equipment.  The line of credit agreement requires monthly interest payments at
 .50% below the bank's prime rate of interest or 1.75% above LIBOR  which was
5.625% at March 31, 1998.  There were no principal borrowings during the years
ended March 31, 1998 and 1997.

The loan agreement contains restrictive covenants when amounts are outstanding
which, among other things, require the Company to maintain a maximum total
liabilities to net worth ratio, a minimum current ratio and a debt coverage
ratio.  The Company is allowed to pay dividends on its common stock if it is
in compliance with the financial covenants and ratios.

The term loan, bank at March 31, 1998 matures in 2012 and requires principal
payments of $4,083, plus interest.  Interest is calculated at 2.25% above
LIBOR which was 5.625% at March 31, 1998.  The bank has the option of
adjusting the monthly payments required under this loan to provide for changes
in the interest rates.  The term and equipment loans are cross-collateralized
with and have the same restrictive covenants as the line of credit (see Note
6).

Principal payments on long-term debt, based on current interest rates, are as
follows:

                       1999             $  117,000

8. Defined contribution pension plan:

A defined contribution pension plan covers all full time employees who meet
age and service requirements.  Contributions to the plan, determined at the
discretion of the Board of Directors, were $28,000 and $29,000 in 1998 and
1997,respectively.  

9. Common stock:
Nonqualified stock option plans provide for the grant of options to purchase
up to 300,000 shares.  Upon the termination or expiration of any stock options
granted, the shares covered by such terminated or expired stock options will
be available for further grant; 38,587 options were available for grant at
March 31, 1998.  The Board of Directors, at the date of grant of an option,
determines the number of shares subject to the grant and the terms of such
option.  All outstanding options granted expire after 5 years and vest over
two years.

At March 31, 1998, 36,675 and 115,200 options had an exercise price of $3.44
and $6.16, respectively.  Such options had remaining contractual lives of 2.3
years and 3.7 years, respectively.

The Company in accordance with an election under generally accepted accounting
principles for stock options has recorded no compensation cost for its stock
options in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Had compensation cost for stock options been determined based on the fair
value at the grant dates for awards under the plans, the Company's net income
and income per share would have been reduced to the proforma amounts disclosed
below:

</TABLE>

Proforma net income does not reflect options granted before April 1, 1995. 
Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation cost for stock options
is not reflected in the proforma  amounts presented above because compensation
cost is reflected over the options' vesting period of two years and compensa-
tion cost for options granted in the year ended March 31, 1995 are not consid-
ered for the year ended March 31, 1997.

The fair values were determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted average assumptions:

                                      1998             1997

During 1997, warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of common stock at $9.76 a
share were issued and remain outstanding at March 31, 1998.

11. Litigation:
In the normal course of business, there are various outstanding legal pro-
ceedings.  In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal
counsel, the consolidated financial statements of the Company will not be
materially affected by the outcome of such legal proceedings.

12. Year 2000:
The Company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely
impacted by Year 2000 software failures.  Software failures due to processing
errors potentially arising from calculations using the Year 2000 date are a
known risk.  The Company is addressing this risk to the availability and
integrity of financial systems and the reliability of operating systems.  The
Company has established processes for evaluating and managing the risks and
costs associated with this problem.  The total cost of compliance and its
effect on the Company's future results of operations is being determined as
part of the detailed conversion planning.
