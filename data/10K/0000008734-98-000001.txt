Item 1.     Description of Business

     (a)     Business Development 

     The Registrant (hereinafter "Company" or "Ambassador") is a Delaware
corporation incorporated in 1963.  It is engaged, through divisions and a
subsidiary, in the food service and janitorial industries in Iowa, Kansas,
New York, Texas, New Jersey, Missouri, and Oklahoma.

   The principal business activity of the Company is the servicing of its 
customer accounts, primarily factories, offices, hospitals, schools, and social 
service agencies, through the use of vending machines, cafeterias, and 
prepared meals delivered from Company commissaries.
     On August 1, 1989, the name of the Company was changed from Automatique,
Incorporated to Ambassador Food Services Corporation.

     (b)     Business of Issuer

     (1)     Description of Business Done by the Registrant in its Food Segment

     (i and ii)The vending and cafeteria segment of the Company's business 
               consists of contracting to distribute beverages and food products
               to customer locations consisting of factories, offices, 
               hospitals, and schools.  The Company conducts surveys of 
               potential customer locations, determines profitability of the 
               location, and submits a proposal offering to provide the vending 
               and/or cafeteria service for the customer location.  Business 
               with local government social service agencies and not-for-profit 
               agencies is obtained through competitive bidding and is 
               serviced by producing meals in a central commissary and 
               delivering them to various designated points for consumption.

     (iii)     No new products have been developed by this segment.  The 
               Company, in general, markets the product developed by its 
               suppliers. 

     (iv)     The vending food service business, made up of a few large 
              companies and many small independently owned local and 
              regional enterprises, is highly competitive.  The practice in the 
              industry is to operate under written agreements with the 
              locations served.  In the market areas where the Company is 
              located, it has national, regional, and local competition, some of
              which have substantially greater total sales and assets.  
              Competition for locations in the food service industry 
              normally comes in the form of pricing and in quality of 
              service and product.

     (v)     Raw materials, consisting of packaged products and commodities, are
             purchased from manufacturers and purveyors and are warehoused 
             or processed by the Company in the local market. There is an 
             adequate supply of raw materials from normal sources; which 
             include Midwest Food Distributors, Inc., Pepsi Cola General
             Bottlers and Loeb and Mayer.
            
     (vi)     During the year ended May 29, 1997, this segment had no single 
              customer whose sales were equal to 10 percent or more of the 
              Company's consolidated revenues.

          Because the Company's customers are primarily the employees and 
          students of the various schools, colleges, factories, offices, and 
          hospitals at which it has its vending and cafeteria services, the 
          Company normally experiences a seasonal decline in sales during the 
          summer months and around holidays, during which times many of these
          customers vacation and many locations close completely.

     (vii)     The distinctive logo associated with the Company has been 
               registered under the laws of the United States relating to 
               trade names and trademarks.  The Company regards such logo as 
               valuable and will maintain the registration in effect for 
               continuing use in connection with the Company's business.  In 
               addition, the segment is a party to the following labor 
               agreements:
<TABLE>

</TABLE>

     (viii)     The Company does not have a material portion of its business 
                subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of 
                the Government.

     (ix)     The Company does not believe that existing or probable government 
              regulations have a material effect on its operation.

     (b)     (2)     Description of Business Done by the Registrant in its 
                     Janitorial Segment

      (i and ii)     The janitorial and maintenance service division of the 
                     Company's business consists primarily of contracting
                     various types of routine cleaning services for            
                     customers on a weekly, monthly, or as-needed basis.
                     Customers currently include grocery stores and public     
                     housing complexes in New York and New Jersey.             

     (iii)     No new products have been introduced by this segment.

     (iv)     The janitorial segment is limited to the New Jersey and New York 
              metropolitan areas. Competition for janitorial contracts comes in 
              the form of pricing and quality of service.  Competition in 
              general is from regional and local companies.

     (v)     The sources and availability of raw materials for this segment are 
             adequate.  Sources of raw materials include Graco Manufacturing 
             and Malone Chemical.

     (vi)     During fiscal 1997, this segment had no single customer whose 
              sales were equal to 10 percent or more of the Company's 
              consolidated revenues.

          This segment is not subject to material fluctuations in sales volume 
          due to seasonality.

          Sales in this segment are on open accounts receivable.  Inventory 
          levels are not significant.

     (vii)     This segment is operating without registered trademarks or 
               patents.  The segment is a party to a labor agreement with 
               the United Service Employees Union #377 in New York that expires 
               December 31, 1999.

     (viii)     The Company does not have a material portion of its business 
                subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of the 
                Government. 

     (ix)     The Company does not believe that existing or probable government 
              regulations have a material effect on its operations.


     (b)     (x) Through (xii) with Respect to the Registrant's Business in 
                General

          (x)     The Company has not incurred any expense for research and 
                  development activities during any of its last two (2) 
                  fiscal years.

          (xi)     Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and 
                   regulations involving the protection of the environment 
                   will not have a material effect.

          (xii)     As of May 29, 1997, the Company and its subsidiary employed 
                    approximately 300 persons.

     shops, and commissaries in each of its market areas throughout fiscal 1997,
     except for the property located at 3269 Roanoke Road, which was 
     purchased in July 1990.  The property was encumbered by a mortgage in the

Item 6.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
            Results of Operations

     Results of Continuing Operations

     1997 Results

     Despite growth in sales of more than $ 2,000,000 from fiscal 1996 levels, 
     Ambassador experienced a before tqax loss from continuing operations of
     $1,164,217 compared to a before tax profit of $ 50,244 in 1996.  Growth in 
     sales waas provided through the acquisition of a competitor in the Des 
     Moines, Iowa market during the latter part of fiscal 1996 and the opening 
     of a new operation in Tyler, Texas during the second quarter of 1997.

     The loss reflects poor results in the Company's Midwest operations and the
     costs associated with the sales of Ambassador's ooperations in St. Louis.
     During 1997, operating losses of $432,000 were recorded in the St. Louis 
     operation with an additional loss of $199,000 recorded on the sales of the
     operation.  The new operation in Tyler, Texas failed to meet sales 
     objectives and produced a loss of $31,000 during the year.  The operation 
     in Tyler has been closed during fiscal 1998.

     Cost of food products sold continue to increase as a percentage of sales.
     This problem impacted all markets as cost of products rose dramatically 
     during the year and price increases implemented were not adequate to offset
     the effect of these rising costs.  Management continues to persue pricing
     as well as purchasing opportunities to improve gross margins.

     Operating costs increased dramatically due to the cost associated with the
     closing of the St. Louis operation as well as high operating lease costs 
     that relate to the acquisition in Iowa.  Administrative cost increased as a
     percentage of sales due to higher payroll costs.  Additionally, the Company
     experienced unusually high costs relating to placement fees within the
     Company's corporate accounting office and late payment fees for various 
     obligations.  Management has taken steps to reduce operating and 
     administrative cost through staff reductions and stringent controls on
     expenditures in all areas.

     1996 Results
     
     Income from continuing operations declined from the 1995 level despite 
     increased sales of $836,773 during the year ended May 30, 1996.  These 
     earnings were $50,224 in fiscal 1996, down from $180,052 in 1995.  A 
     change in the reserve relating to the Company's discontinued restaurant 
     operations brought the net result to a loss of $42,076.  
     This disappointing result reflects continued deterioration in margins in
     the Company's vending and cafeteria operations.  While management 
     implemented price increases throughout the year, food costs continued to
     rise at a substantial rate resulting in a decline in margins during the 
     year.  Price increases and improved controls and purchasing are being 
     implemented to address this problem.  It is imperative that margins 
     improve for the Company to return to profitability.

     All other cost areas combined remained near 1995 levels in relation to 
     sales.  Operating costs were lower as a percentage of sales due to lower
     operating payroll; however, increased administrative payroll and 
     interest costs offset these decreases.

     Year 2000

     Management has reviewed its systems relative to the Year 2000 issue and has
     determined that no material expenditures will be required for modifications
     or replacement of software due to this problem.  Management does anticipate
     replacing its primary financial reporting and control systems as part of 
     its short-term business plan and will ensure that all new systems are Year
     2000 compliant.

     Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Working Capital at the close of fiscal 1997 was a deficit of almost     
     $2,000,000.  This reflects the impact of the loss incurred during fiscal  
     1997 coupled with the $1,000,000 deficit at the end of fiscal 1996.  The 
     Company has implemented stringent controls on capital expenditures and has 
     idle equipment in its vending operations to support substantial growth in 
     sales,if needed.

     Management has been successful in attaining financing during fiscal 1998
     necessary to meet its current obligations.  Additionally, payments being  
     received on the sale of its St. Louis operations continue to provide 
     capital.  While financing continues to be available for the Company's
     capital equipment needs, Ambassador's ability to maintain its lending
     relationships are dependent upon a return to profitability.

Ambassador Food Services Corporation and Subsidiary


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ambassador Food 
Services Corporation and Subsidiary as of May 29, 1997 and May 30, 1996 and the 
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, 
and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable 
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Ambassador Food
Services Corporation and Subsidiary as of May 29, 1997 and May 30, 1996 and 
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years

                    Ambassador Food Services Corporation and Subsidiary
                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                       Years ended May 29, 1997 and May 30, 1996


A.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     A summary of the significant accounting policies consistently applied in
     the preparation of the accompanying consolidated fanancial statements 
     follows.

     1.     Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ambassador Food  
Services Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ambassador Fast   
Services,Inc. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated.

     2.     Nature of Business

The Company and its subsidiary are engaged in two segments:  food service 
(vending, cafeteria and catering) and janitorial service.  The Company's 
customers are principally located in the Midwest and Northeast United States.

     3.     Reporting Periods

The Company has a fiscal year (52 or 53 weeks) ending on the Thursday nearest 
May 31.  Both fiscal years 1997 and 1996 contained 52 weeks.

     4.     Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or 
market.

     5.     Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is
provided in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable assets to 
operations over their estimated useful lives on the straight-line method.
The estimated lives used in determining depreciation are:

           Vending equipment                              8 years
           Cafeteria and commissary equipment          3-10 years
           Building and leasehold improvements         3-22 years
           Other                                        2-4 years

     6.     Location Contracts and Excess of Purchase Price Over Net Assets 
            Acquired 
Location contracts and excess of purchase price over net assets acquired arise 
from the purchase of various companies and are carried at cost.  Location 
contracts represent the amount paid for customer vending relationships in 
existence at the time of acquisition which were generally cancelable by either 
party with limited notice.  Amounts resulting from acquisitions prior to 
November 1, 1970 ($1,064,787) were not amortized and relate mainly to St. 
Louis operations.  During 1997, these costs for St. Louis were disposed of in
conjunction with the sales of the operation (see Note O).  Acquisitions of 
$568,173 expended subsequent to November 1, 1970 are being amortized on a  
straight-line basis over 5 to 40 years.  

          The Company's management continually evaluates the carrying value of 
their intangible assets based upon local market and economic conditions, and, in
their opinion, there has been no diminution in the value of these assets.

     7.     Unrecognized Prior Service Costs

Unrecognized prior service costs, related to the defined benefit pension plan 
discussed in Note H, are being amortized straight-line over the average 
remaining service period of the participants included in the plan.

     8.     Costs and Expenses

Preopening costs associated with new vending and cafeteria accounts are expensed
as incurred.

     9.     Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share

Loss per share has been computed using the weighted average common 
shares outstanding during the period.  In addition to these shares, certain 
stock options and convertible debt exist that were outstanding during the  
reporting periods.  These common stock equivalents were not considered in the 
net loss per share calculation for fiscal year 1997 and 1996 as their effect 
is antidilutive. 
          
     10.     Statements of Cash Flows

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash includes cash on hand, in banks, and 
in change funds.

     11.     Concentration of Credit Risk

Approximately $1,300,000 in 1997 and $1,500,000 of the Company's accounts 
receivable, are with customers located in the Northeast 
United States.  The Company grants credit to customers; which includes 
businesses, schools, and governmental agencies.  Collateral is generally not 
required.


     12.     Use of Estimates

In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ 
from those estimates.

     13.     Financial Instruments

The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments, including cash, 
accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, line of credit, and 
long-term debt, approximate fair value.

     14.     Reclassifications

Certain items in the 1996 consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 1997 presentation.

B.     REALIZATION OF ASSETS

       The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
       conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which 
       contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.

       Recoverability of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying
       consolidated balance sheets is dependent upon continued operations of the
       Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company's ability to meet 
       its financing requirements on a continuing basis and to succeed in its
       future operations.  These financial statements do not include any 
       adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
       asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be
       necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.

       Management has taken the following steps to revise its operating and
       financial reqquirements, which it believes are sufficient to provide the 
       Company with the ability to continue in existence:

              Certain unprofitable operations have been closed
              Several administrative and regional positions have been eliminated
              Steps to improve margins and reduce costs have been taken.
              Making current operations profitable and growing through intenal
                sales efforts have become the Company's focus.
              The existing lender refinanced the equipment loan and the Company
                obtained a short-term loan to provide additional liquidity.
              Total debt has been reduced and debt service requirements
                sucstantially decrease in June 1998.

H.     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan covering two key 
employees and three former officers of the Company.  Under the terms of the 
plan, each individual will receive a fixed monthly payment for ten years

     The Company contributed approximately $74,000 and $83,000 in fiscal years 
1997 and 1996, respectively, to several multi-employer pension plans for 
employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. These plans are not 
administered by the Company, and contributions are determined in accordance 
with provisions of negotiated labor contracts.  

     The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980(the Act) 
significantly increased the pension responsibilities of participating employers.
Under the provisions of the Act, if the plans terminate or the Company 
withdraws, the Company could be subject to a substantial "withdrawl liability."
Management has no intention of undertaking any action which would subject the 
Company to this obligation.

     The Company has a defined contribution plan that covers all permanent 
nonunion employees.  Under the terms of the plan, employees can contribute 
up to a maximum of 15% of their gross annual salary.  Company contributions 
to the Plan are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.  The Company made 
no contributions to this plan during fiscal year 1997 or 1996. 

I.     STOCK OPTIONS

In fiscal year 1993, the Board of Directors granted nonstatutory options for
40,000 shares to an officer and certain key employees.  These options expired of 
unexercised subsequent to May 29, 1997.  

In fiscal year 1996, the Board of Directors approved the granting of 
nonstatutory options for 65,000 shares to certain key employees.  The 
exercise price of the options was $1 per share, which approximated the fair 
market value of the shares on the date of grant of the option.  The options were
exercised during fiscal year 1996.

Stock option transactions for the two years are summarized below:

</TABLE>

The valuation allowance was established to reduce the deferred tax asset to the 
amount that will more likely than not be realized.  The reduction is necessary 
due to prior operating losses and uncertainty as to the Company's ability to 
utilize tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards before they expire.  
The valuation allowance was increased $56,534 and $10,759 in 
fiscal years 1997 and 1996, respectively.

The income tax benefit reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
differs from the amounts computed at federal statutory income tax rates.  The

         During fiscal year 1994, the Company established an accrual relating to
a lawsuit filed by the federal government on behalf of the United States 
Department of Agriculture.  To avoid further litigation expenses, an agreement
for settlement was reached.  Terms of the agreement included payment by the

liability for 1988 and before.

          During fiscal year 1997, the Company was assessed $133,233 in taxes 
and penalties by the Missouri Department of Revenue for delinquent sales taxes 
for the period from September 1996 through February 1997.  The Company entered

          Executive Retirement Program

     An executive retirement program was adopted during the 1990 fiscal year to 
provide a target annual retirement benefit at age 65 or upon retirement, if 
later, in an amount equal to approximately 40-45% of annual salary, payable 
for 10 years, for certain salaried employees, including the following officer:  
Robert A. Laudicina.  This target retirement benefit will be provided through 
the combination of (1) discretionary annual cash retirement  bonus payments in 
the amount of $2,000, which must be invested in an individual retirement 
account or a universal life insurance policy, and (2) a nonqualified (for tax 
purposes) supplemental retirement agreement from the Company.  The nonqualified 
retirement agreements will pay the estimated portion of the target retirement 
benefit which cannot be funded by the executive through the annual cash 
retirement bonus payments.  The nonqualified retirement arrangements will 
also provide a pre-retirement death benefit in the event of the executive's 
death prior to age 65.

     These annual retirement benefits of the above named Officer, are estimated 
     to be as follows:

     *based upon contributions of $2,000 per year until age 65 and interest at

amounts estimated to be sufficient to reimburse it for most of the supplemental 
retirement and/or death benefit payments.

remunerations exceeded $100,000 as of May 29, 1997.
