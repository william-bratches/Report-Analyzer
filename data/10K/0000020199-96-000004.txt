                                     PART I

               Item 1:       DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

               Church Loans &  Investments  Trust ("the Trust") is a real estate
               investment  trust  organized under the laws of the State of Texas
               in March 1963.  Although the Trust has the authority to engage in
               the business of buying,  selling and leasing of real estate,  the
               Trust has heretofore restricted its business activities primarily
               to making  loans to churches  and other  nonprofit  organizations
               which are secured by a first  mortgage  on real  estate  owned by
               such borrowers.

               The  period  of  duration  of  the  Trust,  unless  dissolved  in
               accordance with law, or by the consent of the owners of shares of
               beneficial interest in the Trust, is perpetual.  The Trust may be
               dissolved by the affirmative  vote of not less than two-thirds of
               the owners of outstanding shares of the Trust.  Owners of Secured
               Savings Certificates, a debt instrument issued by the Trust, have
               no vote in  regard  to any  activities  of the  Trust,  including
               dissolution.

               The  control  and  management  of the Trust  properties,  and all
               powers  necessary  or  appropriate  to effect  any and all of the
               purposes for which the Trust is organized, is vested in the Board
               of Trust Managers.  All managers are members of a congregation of
               the Church of Christ.

               The number of shares of  beneficial  interest  in the Trust which
               the Trust is authorized to issue is unlimited.

               The Trust is qualified as a "real estate  investment trust" under
               Sections  856-858 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended
               (the "Internal  Revenue Code" or "Code").  It is the intention of
               the Trust to  continue  to  qualify as a real  estate  investment
               trust under the Code.

               The  Trust  maintains  an  office  located  at  5305  I-40  West,
               Amarillo, TX 79106 (telephone 806/358-3666).

               As  mentioned  above,  the  Trust  is  primarily  engaged  in the
               business of making mortgage loans to churches and other nonprofit
               organizations. The Declaration of Trust restricts the investments
               of the Trust to loans secured by a first mortgage,  deed of trust
               or other  lien  covering  real  property  with the amount of such
               loans not to  exceed  66 2/3% of the  value of the real  property
               securing  such  loan as  determined  by a  competent  independent
               appraiser.  Although the Trust has been primarily in the business
               of making long-term mortgage loans, during the past several years
               it has  been  more  involved  in  making  short-term  interim  or
               construction   loans  to  finance  the   construction  of  church
               buildings, the purchase of real

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

               estate, or the refinancing of existing indebtedness. Most, if not
               all, of the interim loans  presently  being made by the Trust are
               associated  with bond  offerings of churches and other  nonprofit
               organizations.  These  interim  loans are  scheduled to be repaid
               from the proceeds of the bond offerings.

               The Trust is not limited to the location of the property securing
               any  loans  in which  it may  invest  and  seeks  to  spread  its
               investments in areas of the United States where favorable  yields
               prevail.

               As of March 31,  1996,  the Trust has 173  permanent  and interim
               mortgage loans and investments in church bonds having a principal
               balance of $33,680,044, with the average principal amount thereof
               being  $194,682.34.  The interest  rates on these loans vary from
               7.0% to 17% per annum with the weighted  average interest rate of
               mortgage  loans and church  bonds being 11.21% per annum at March
               31, 1996. The original terms of these loans vary from one year to
               thirty years, with the majority being for a term of twenty years.

               During the fiscal year of the Trust ending  March 31,  1996,  the
               net income of the Trust was $2,359,130, as compared to $2,344,026
               in fiscal 1995, an increase of .006%.  The increase in net income
               of the Trust was due  primarily  to an increase  in net  interest
               income in fiscal 1996 as compared to fiscal 1995.

               The net  income  of the  Trust  for each of the  quarters  during
               fiscal  1996  was as  follows:  first  quarter  $644,032;  second
               quarter  $596,635;  third quarter  $587,838;  and fourth  quarter
               $530,625.

               The  operational  expense of the Trust  increased  from  $553,444
               during  fiscal 1995 to $554,397 in fiscal 1996.  The  operational
               expenses  of the  Trust  were  approximately  13.18% of its gross
               income for the year ended  March 31,  1996 as  compared to 12.56%
               for the year ended March 31, 1995. The operational expense of the
               Trust   included   general  and   administrative   expenses   and
               compensation to members of the Board of Trust Managers.

               During  fiscal  1996,   the  Trust   advanced  loan  proceeds  of
               $11,424,033  on 34  different  loans.  Most,  if not all, of such
               loans bear  interest at a variable  rate equal to 2% per annum in
               excess of the prime rate of interest published by the Wall Street
               Journal and known as the "Wall Street Journal Prime."

               During  fiscal  1996,  the Trust  employed a total of 4 full time
               employees  and  employed,  as needed,  one  additional  part-time
               employee.

               Item 2: DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY

               The Trust  maintains  as its only place of  business  its offices
               located at 5305 I-40 West, in Amarillo,  Texas.  Such building is
               owned by the Trust and is occupied solely by the Trust.  There is
               no debt owed by Trust in regard to its real  property.  The Trust
               also owns certain vacant land adjacent to the trust property that
               is held for investment.

               The real properties of the Trust are not a significant portion of
               the  Trust's  assets,  representing  less than 1% of the  Trust's
               total assets.

               As  previously  mentioned,  the Trust's  primary  business is the
               making  of  mortgage  loans  to  churches  and  other   nonprofit
               organizations. The Declaration of Trust restricts the investments
               of the Trust to loans secured by a first mortgage, deed of trust,
               or other  lien  covering  real  property  with the amount of such
               loans not to  exceed  66 2/3% of the  value of the real  property
               securing such loan.  The  Declaration of Trust may not be amended
               without the vote of two- thirds (2/3 rds) of the  Certificates of
               Beneficial   Interest  entitled  to  vote.  The  Board  of  Trust
               Managers'  general policy is to limit  investment of Trust assets
               in any one mortgage  loan to not more than  $2,000,000.  All such
               investment in mortgage loans is for the purpose of earning income
               for the Trust.

               (a)           Market Information

               There is no  established  public trading market for the shares of
               beneficial  interest of the Trust.  During fiscal 1996 a total of
               81,805 shares were sold in the secondary market at prices ranging
               from  $2.25 to $2.31 per share.  The last sale  during the fiscal
               year was at $2.25 per share.  During  fiscal year 1995 a total of
               171,610  shares  were  sold in the  secondary  market  at  prices
               ranging from $2.00 to $2.50 per share.

               fiscal  1996 the Trust  paid a total  cash  dividend  of $.32 per
               share.

               Item 6: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION
               Results of Operations--1996 compared to 1995

               During the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996,  interest income and
               fees of the Trust decreased by $199,754 (4.53%) over the previous
               fiscal  year.  Such  decrease  was  primarily  attributable  to a
               decrease  in the  amount  of  both  mortgage  loans  and  interim
               construction   loans   held  by  the   Trust.   Earning   interim
               construction  loans  decreased  from  $10,148,958 as of March 31,
               1995 to  $7,877,489  as of March 31, 1996.  Furthermore,  earning
               mortgage loans and church bonds decreased from  $25,676,746 as of
               March 31, 1995 to $21,886,390 as of March 31, 1996. Such decrease
               in mortgage  loans and church  bonds is primarily a result of the
               normal payoff upon maturity of loans held by the Trust as well as
               the payoff  prior to  maturity  of loans held by the Trust.  Such
               decrease in interest  income and fees was  somewhat  offset by an
               increase in the average annual  interest rate on loans and church
               bonds from 10.94% at March 31, 1995 to 11.21% at March 31, 1996.

               In fiscal  1996,  the  average  aggregate  amount  of total  debt
               outstanding was $3,946,475 less than in fiscal 1995. Furthermore,
               interest  expense  decreased  by  $223,743.   Such  decrease  was

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

               primarily  due  to a  decrease  in the  debt  of  the  Trust  and
               secondarily  to a  decrease  in the  Trust's  cost of funds.  The
               decrease in the debt of the Trust was primarily due to a decrease
               in  interim  loans made by the Trust.  The  approximate  weighted
               average annual interest rate upon the aggregate  outstanding debt
               increased  from 7.29% during  fiscal 1995 to 7.72% during  fiscal
               1996.

               The net income of the Trust increased  $15,104  (0.006%) from the
               previous fiscal year. Such increase was primarily attributable to
               an increase in net interest  income in fiscal 1996 as compared to
               fiscal 1995.

               During fiscal 1996,  the prime interest rate decreased from 9.00%
               at March 31,  1995 to 8.25% per annum at March 31,  1996.  Should
               the prime interest rate decrease during fiscal 1997, the interest
               expense of the Trust will  generally  decrease and the net income
               of the Trust will in turn  generally  increase.  Should the prime
               interest rate increase  during fiscal 1997, the interest  expense
               of the Trust will  generally  increase  and the net income of the
               Trust will in turn generally decrease.

               Principal  payments  received on the interim and  permanent  loan
               portfolio and the church bonds held by the Trust  increased  from
               $15,623,167 during fiscal 1995 to $18,434,281 during fiscal 1996,
               an increase of 17.99%.  This increase was primarily  attributable
               to the  increase  in interim  loans held by the Trust as of March
               31,  1995 which  were paid off  during  the fiscal  year and to a
               decrease in the amount of non-performing  loans of the Trust from
               $3,405,793  as of March 31,  1995 to  $2,769,345  as of March 31,
               1996. The  non-performing  loans of  the Trust as compared to the
               entire loan portfolio of the Trust decreased  slightly from 8.68%
               as of March 31, 1995 to 8.51% as of March 31, 1996.

               Liquidity and Capital Resources

               The Trust is  engaged in the  business  of making  permanent  and
               interim loans to churches and other non-profit organizations. The
               assets of the Trust primarily  consist of its loan portfolio with
               the Trust owning no real property other than its office  building
               and facilities. The operational expense of the Trust is comprised
               of the  maintenance  of its office  building,  the payment of the
               salaries of its management and clerical staff and the payment for
               legal and  accounting  services.  Substantially  all of the Trust
               assets are invested in the  permanent  and interim  loans made by
               the Trust. The only potential liquidity problems of the Trust are
               related to the timely  and proper  repayment  by the Trust of the
               leveraged  funds it has  borrowed  to make loans in excess of its
               capital.  All  of the  indebtedness  of the  Trust  is  generally
               classified  as short  term  having  maturities  ranging  from "on
               demand" to maturities  repayable over various  periods  extending
               through 1999.

               The  annual  maturities  upon all debt  obligations  of the Trust
               outstanding  as of March 31, 1996 for the next three fiscal years
               are:  1997--$7,176,063;   1998-$2,865,068;  and  1999-$2,060,324.
               These debt obligations primarily consist of the Trust's bank line
               of credit and Secured Savings Certificates ("Certificates") which
               have  been   previously   issued  by  the   Trust.   Certificates
               outstanding as of March 31, 1996 that will mature during the next
               three   years  are:   1997--$2,619,983;   1998--$2,865,068;   and
               1999-$2,060,324.

               At March 31, 1996 loans to the Trust under Master Note Agreements
               which are in effect demand notes total  $4,006,079.  In the past,
               the Trust has utilized its bank line of credit, principal paid to
               the Trust upon its outstanding  loan portfolio,  and the proceeds
               received  from  the  sale of  Certificates  in  order to meet its
               maturing obligations.

               At March 31,  1996,  the  balance  which could be borrowed by the
               Trust upon its bank line of credit was $9,449,999.  The principal
               payments  scheduled  to be  received  by the Trust  upon its loan
               portfolio for the years ending March 31, 1997,  1998 and 1999 are
               $11,557,673,  $2,105,685, and $1,890,629,  respectively. Assuming
               all of these  scheduled  principal  payments are received,  these
               payments,  together with the balance available to Church Loans on
               its  bank  line of  credit,  would  allow  Church  Loans  to have
               sufficient  funds to meet its  maturing  obligation  without  the
               necessity  for  Church  Loans  having  to  sell  any   additional
               Certificates or borrow funds from other sources.

               During  fiscal 1996 and 1995 the Trust sold  Certificates  in the
               principal amounts of $4,595,999 and $5,239,231, respectively. Due
               to the cost of  registration  and of sales of such  Certificates,
               the cost of these  funds  are  normally  higher  than the cost of
               borrowing from bank sources or master notes. Therefore, effective
               July 18, 1994, the Trust decided not to register Certificates. As
               a  result  of  such   action,   the  Trust  was  unable  to  sell
               Certificates  from such date until  September  7, 1995,  when the
               registration of additional  Certificates became effective.  Based
               upon the success of the Trust to sell  Certificates  in the past,
               the Trust is confident that,  should it be necessary,  it will be
               able to sell Certificates in the future in sufficient amounts for
               the Trust to timely  meet all of its  obligations.  To the extent
               that  Certificates  sold by the Trust have maturity  dates of one
               year, or less, the financial  condition of the Trust would not be
               substantially  improved since the proceeds  received by the Trust
               from the sale of Certificates will, of necessity,  be used to pay
               the  principal and interest  upon  Certificates  maturing in this
               period.

               Should all the  scheduled  principal  payments upon loans made by
               the Trust not be received, and should the Trust be unable to sell
               Certificates  with maturity dates and in amounts  described above
               or should  the Trust be  unable  to  borrow  against  its line of
               credit,  and should loans from other  sources not be available it
               would  be

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

               necessary  for the Trust to sell a portion of its  mortgage  loan
               portfolio  in  order  for  it  to  meet  all  of  its   financial
               obligations. At March 31, 1996, the principal balance of the loan
               and  church  bond  portfolio  of the Trust was  $32,533,224.  The
               weighted  average  interest  rate on loans and  church  bonds was
               11.21%  per  annum.  In  view  of  the  normal  marketability  of
               conventional  loans,  the Trust  would  probably  be  required to
               discount  the great  majority of these loans in order for them to
               be attractive for purchase.  The principal  amount of these loans
               if discounted to yield a weighted  average  interest rate of 12%,
               14% and 16% would be $30,391,450,  $26,049,814,  and $22,793,588,
               respectively.  There is no assurance that the Trust would be able
               to sell all, or a portion of, its  portfolio  of loans,  in which
               event,  it would be necessary  for the Trust to secure a loan, or
               loans, from a lender in order for the Trust to meet its financial
               obligations.  There is no assurance  that the Trust would be able
               to secure a loan in such instance. The Trust has sold only one of
               the  loans in its  mortgage  loan  portfolio  and  therefore  has
               limited experience in this area.

               Principal payments scheduled to be received by the Trust upon its
               permanent loan portfolio  during the years ending March 31, 1997,
               1998 and 1999, if not used to fund new loan commitments, would be
               used to reduce the outstanding  indebtedness of the Trust. Should
               the Trust use the payments of  principal  which shall be received
               upon its loan portfolio to reduce its  outstanding  indebtedness,
               the  interest  expense  of  the  Trust  will  decrease.  In  such
               instance,  whether  the  decrease  in the  interest  income  will
               exceed,  or be less than,  the decrease in the  interest  expense
               will  largely  be  dependent  upon  the  prime  rate of  interest
               prevailing  at such time due to the fact that the  interest to be
               earned by the Trust upon its mortgage loan portfolio is generally
               based  upon a  fixed  rate  of  interest  or a  variable  rate of
               interest  that  periodically  reprices,  while the interest to be
               paid by the Trust  upon its  outstanding  debts is  directly,  or
               indirectly,  tied to the prime rate of interest  charged by major
               domestic banks.

               As of March 31, 1996,  a  substantial  portion of the  promissory
               notes evidencing the loans made by the Trust have been pledged to
               secure its outstanding indebtedness. At March 31, 1996 promissory
               notes in the principal  amount of $9,424,292  had been pledged to
               secure  Certificates which had been previously sold by the Trust.
               The  required  collateral  for these  Certificates  (based on the
               ratio of 1.25 to 1 of notes pledged to the  principal  balance of
               the  Certificates  in  Series  A-N  and a  ratio  of 1.0 to 1 for
               Certificates  in Series O) was  $8,282,719,  leaving an excess of
               promissory  notes which have been  pledged by the Trust to secure
               said Certificates of $1,141,573.  Additionally,  promissory notes
               totalling $9,691,421 were pledged against the bank line of credit
               which had a total outstanding  balance of $550,001.  The required
               collateral for this bank loan was $605,001,  leaving an excess of
               promissory  notes  which have been  pledged  to secure  said bank
               notes  of  $9,086,420.  These  excess  promissory  notes  may  be
               reassigned  by the  Indenture  Trustee

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

               or bank to the  Trust to be sold in order  for the  Trust to meet
               its  financial  obligations.  Should it be necessary in order for
               the Trust to meet its financial  obligations,  these excess notes
               amounting to $10,227,993 and other additional promissory notes in
               the  approximate  amount of  $13,417,511  (for a total  amount of
               $23,645,504)  would be  available to be sold by the Trust to meet
               its financial obligations.  Should the excess promissory notes be
               assigned  by the  Indenture  Trustee  or  bank  to the  Trust  as
               heretofore  described,  all outstanding  Certificates sold by the
               Trust and the bank line of credit would continue to be secured by
               the required  ratio of notes pledged to the principal  balance of
               these  Certificates  and the  bank  line of  credit.  There is no
               assurance  that  the  Trust  would  be able to sell  all,  or any
               portion of these notes.

               Cash flows from operating  activities  consists  primarily of net
               income.  The primary components of net income are interest income
               and  expense.  Interest  income  should  continue  to be the main
               source of cash  provided by operating  activities;  however,  the
               availability  of this cash flow is dependent  upon the ability of
               the borrowers to repay loans. The amount of non-performing  loans
               as of March  31,  1996  compared  to March  31,  1995  decreased.
               Accordingly,  cash provided by operating  activities has been and
               is expected to be a relatively stable source of cash flow.

               Cash flows  from  investing  activities  results  primarily  from
               investment  in and  payments  received  on  mortgage  and interim
               construction loans and church bonds.

               Cash flows from financing activities relate primarily to the sale
               of and payments on  Certificates  and  borrowings and payments on
               notes payable and the line of credit.  Certificates  are sold and
               borrowings  are  made as funds  are  needed  to make  loans or as
               current  obligations  become  due.  Based upon the success of the
               Trust to sell Certificates and obtain borrowings in the past, the
               Trust is confident that it will be able to sell  Certificates and
               obtain borrowings in the future in sufficient amounts, along with
               payments to be received on loans, to timely meet its obligations.

               Inflation

               At March 31, 1996,  the  weighted  average  interest  rate on the
               mortgage  loan and church bond  portfolio of the Trust was 11.21%
               per  annum  while the  weighted  average  interest  rate upon all
               borrowings of the Trust was 7.10% per annum.  Although a majority
               of the loans  constituting  the loan  portfolio of the Trust have
               been made at variable  rates of interest that  generally  reprice
               annually,  a portion of the loans  constituting  the Trust's loan
               portfolio have been made at fixed rates of interest and therefore
               are not subject to being  increased or decreased  during the term
               of the  loan.  All of the  indebtedness  of the  Trust is  either
               directly or indirectly tied to the prime rate of interest charged
               by major banking

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

               institutions  and  therefore  is subject to  fluctuation.  During
               periods of inflation, the prime rate of interest charged by major
               banking  institutions,  as well as the  interest  rate or cost of
               borrowing   money   from   any   lender,   generally   increases.
               Consequently,  during an inflationary period the interest expense
               of the Trust would  increase.  Since the  interest  income of the
               Trust would not increase as rapidly,  an increase in the interest
               expense of the Trust would  decrease the net income of the Trust.
               However, interest income should subsequently increase as variable
               rate loans reprice. Should the amount of the loans and the amount
               of the indebtedness of the Trust remain constant,  and should the
               weighted average interest rate upon the indebtedness  increase to
               approximately  34.77%  per  annum,  the  interest  income and the
               interest expense of the Trust would be substantially equal.

The Board of Trust Managers and Shareholders
Church Loans & Investments Trust
Amarillo, Texas

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

We have audited the  accompanying  balance  sheet of Church Loans &  Investments
Trust (a real estate  investment  trust) as of March 31,  1996,  and the related
statements  of income,  shareholders'  equity,  and cash flows for the year then
ended.  These  financial  statements  are the  responsibility  of the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements  based on our audit. The  accompanying  1995 financial  statements of
Church Loans &  Investments  Trust were audited by other  auditors  whose report
dated May 5, 1995, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the 1996 financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material  respects,  the financial position of Church Loans & Investments
Trust as of March 31, 1996, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for the year then  ended,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

                        CHURCH LOANS & INVESTMENTS TRUST
                        (A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST)

                   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

                       YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 1996 AND 1995

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Church Loans &  Investments  Trust  (Church  Loans) is a real estate  investment
trust that  invests  primarily in mortgage  loans to churches  across the United
States,  particularly in the southern  portion of the U.S.  During 1995,  Church
Loans also began  making  certain  interim  real  estate  construction  loans to
entities other than churches.  Church Loans requires that real estate properties
be pledged  against  mortgage  loans as security  which could be  foreclosed  by
Church  Loans  should  the  borrower  default.   Repayment  of  each  borrower's
obligations is generally  expected to be repaid from  contributions  from church
members,  or in the case of interim  construction  loans, by permanent financing
provided by others.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting  period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CURRENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

Church Loans has historically invested in long-term,  fixed-rate mortgage loans,
generally funded by relatively  short-term secured savings  certificates  (SSCs)
and debt obligations. The volatility of interest rates and increased competition
to attract  customers'  funds have caused Church Loans'  liability  structure to
become short-term and rate sensitive. Church Loans reflected an average interest
yield on its loan and church bond  portfolio,  an average  interest  rate on its
total  indebtedness and a net interest rate margin at March 31, 1996 and 1995 as
follows:

                                   LOAN AND CHURCH      TOTAL       NET INTEREST
                                   BOND PORTFOLIO    INDEBTEDNESS   RATE MARGIN
                                   --------------    ------------   -----------
March 31, 1996 ....................    11.21             7.10           4.11
March 31, 1995 ....................    10.94             8.02           2.92

Church  Loans  finances  maturities  of SSCs and debt  obligations  through  its
available lines of credit,  the issuance of SSCs and principal payments received
on its mortgage loans.

CHURCH BONDS

Church bonds,  secured by first mortgage liens on church facilities,  are stated
at cost,  as there is no traded market for the bonds and  management  intends to
hold such securities until maturity.

The allowance for possible credit losses is established  through a provision for
possible  credit losses  charged to expense.  Loans and church bonds are charged
against the allowance when management  believes that the  collectibility  of the
principal is unlikely. Recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited
to the allowance.  The charge to operations is based on management's  evaluation
of the loan and church bond  portfolio,  including  such factors as the security
collateralizing  the loans or church  bonds,  past  credit loss  experience  and
general  economic  conditions.  The allowance is subjective in nature and may be
adjusted in the near term because of changes in economic conditions.

RECOGNITION OF INTEREST INCOME, ORIGINATION AND
 COMMITMENT FEES AND LOAN DISCOUNTS

Interest  income on mortgage  loans and church bonds is recognized  when earned.
The accrual of interest  income is generally  discontinued on mortgage loans and
church bonds more than 90 days past due or when there is sufficient  doubt as to
the collection of interest.

Loan  origination fees are collected only on a few permanent loans and generally
recognized as income when received and the associated loan origination costs are
expensed when incurred.  The effect on the accompanying  financial statements is
not materially  different from generally  accepted  accounting  principles which
require that loan fees, net of origination costs, be deferred and amortized into
interest income over the life of the related loan.

Commitment fees received on interim  construction  loans are recognized over the
interim commitment period for loans that are not permanently  financed by Church
Loans  and over the life of the  mortgage  loan for loans  that are  permanently
financed by Church Loans.  Amounts are being amortized  using the  straight-line
method.  This method was not  materially  different from the method of deferring
commitment fees until the commitment is exercised and  recognizing  such fees as
an adjustment to yield by the interest  method over the related  loans' lives as
prescribed by generally accepted accounting  principles for each of the years in
the three-year period ended March 31, 1996.

Purchase discounts on loans are amortized based on the interest method.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property  and  equipment  are  stated at cost,  less  accumulated  depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on the  straight-line  method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 18 years.

UNAMORTIZED DEBT EXPENSE

Commissions paid to brokers in connection with the sale of SSCs are deferred and
amortized  over the terms of the related  certificates  on the interest  method.
Costs  incurred in  connection  with the  registration  of SSCs are deferred and
amortized on the straight-line  method over the period the related  certificates
are sold,  but no longer than two years from the date the  registration  becomes
effective.

INCOME TAXES

Income taxes are accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109,  ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES.  Statement 109 requires a change from the
deferred  method of  accounting  for income

taxes of APB  Opinion 11 to the asset and  liability  method of  accounting  for
income taxes.  Under the asset and liability  method of Statement 109,  deferred
tax assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  for the  future tax  consequences
attributable to differences  between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing  assets and liabilities  and their  respective tax bases.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled.  Under Statement 109, the effect on deferred tax assets
and  liabilities  of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date.

CASH FLOWS

For  purposes  of  reporting  cash  flows,  cash  and cash  equivalents  include
cash-on-hand  and investment in a money market mutual fund and  certificates  of
deposit with maturities of less than 90 days at the time of acquisition.

NOTE 1 - MORTGAGE AND INTERIM CONSTRUCTION LOANS

Mortgage loans  receivable  consist of  conventional  loans of  $23,637,917  and
$26,604,107 and church bonds due principally  from  congregations of Churches of
Christ  of  $828,661  and  $957,455  at March 31,  1996 and 1995,  respectively.
Interim  construction  loans of $9,213,466 and $11,669,935 at March 31, 1996 and
1995, respectively,  consist primarily of loans to churches for the construction
of church  facilities.  Mortgage  loans,  church bonds and interim  construction
loans are generally secured by first liens on real estate comprised primarily of
church buildings,  ministers'  residences and other real estate. The amount of a
loan is  generally  limited  to 66-2/3% of the  appraised  value of the  related
property.   Certain  loans  are   guaranteed   by  individual   members  of  the
congregations  or  other   individuals  or   congregations,   depending  on  the
circumstances.  The individual  endorsements  are usually for a specific  amount
with the sum of all such  guarantees  being an amount at least equal to the loan
amount.

Church  Loans'  portfolio  included  mortgage  loans,  church  bonds and interim
construction loans with interest rates ranging from 7% to 17% at March 31, 1996.
The weighted average annual interest rates of Church Loans' loan and church bond
portfolio were 11.21% and 10.94% at March 31, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  The
weighted  average annual  interest rates for the loan and church bond portfolios
were 11.0% for both years ended March 31, 1996 and 1995.

The following schedule is a summary of the combined  mortgage,  church bonds and
interim construction loan portfolios by size of loan at March 31, 1996 and 1995:

In the normal  course of  business,  Church  Loans makes  commitments  to extend
credit which are not reflected in the financial  statements.  These  commitments
involve elements of credit risk,  interest rate risk,  liquidity risk and market
risk.  At March 31, 1996,  Church Loans had  outstanding  loan  commitments  (by
contract  amounts)  of  approximately  $9,841,000.  Church  Loans  has no  other
financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk.

Nonaccrual mortgage loans, church bonds and interim  construction loans at March
31, 1996 and 1995 were $2,769,345 and $3,405,793,  respectively. Interest income
which would have been recorded under the original terms of nonaccrual  loans and
church bonds amounted to approximately $310,000 and $283,000 for the years ended
March  31,  1996  and  1995,  respectively.  No  interest  income  was  actually
recognized.

In addition to the nonaccrual loans previously mentioned,  management has doubts
as to a certain interim loan's ability to comply with present  repayment  terms.
Such loan had a balance of  approximately  $1,556,000  at March 31, 1996 and was
not classified as nonearning at that date.

The  original  terms of the  individual  loans  included  in the loan  portfolio
generally vary from 1 to 30 years.  Scheduled  maturities  during the five years
subsequent to March 31, 1996, are:

                      1997 .............      $11,557,673
                      1998 .............        2,105,685

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 114, ACCOUNTING BY CREDITORS FOR IMPAIRMENT
OF A LOAN. This Statement amends FASB Nos. 5, ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES,  and
15,  ACCOUNTING BY DEBTORS AND CREDITORS FOR TROUBLED DEBT  RESTRUCTURINGS,  and
prescribes the  recognition  criterion for loan  impairment and the  measurement
methods  for  certain  impaired  loans and loans  whose  terms are  modified  in
troubled-debt  restructurings.  The  objective  of  Statement  114 is to provide
consistent  guidance to all  creditors  with loans  included in the scope of the
Statement.  Statement 114 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years
beginning  after December 15, 1994 and is required to be adopted  prospectively.
In October 1994, the FASB issued Statement No. 118,  ACCOUNTING BY CREDITORS FOR
IMPAIRMENT OF A LOAN - INCOME  RECOGNITION  AND  DISCLOSURES.  Statement No. 118
amends  Statement  No.  114 to allow a  creditor  to use  existing  methods  for
recognizing  interest  income on an impaired loan and amends certain  disclosure
requirements.  The adoption of  Statements  No. 114 and No. 118 on April 1, 1995
did not have a material effect on Church Loans' financial statements.

At March 31, 1996, the recorded  investment and the related allowance for credit
losses  for  loans  for which  impairment  was  recognized  in  accordance  with
Statement No. 114 were approximately $2,300,000 and $270,000, respectively.

                        CHURCH LOANS & INVESTMENTS TRUST
                        (A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST)

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                       YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 1996 AND 1995


Maturities  of debt for each of the three years  subsequent  to March 31,  1996,
are:

               1997 ............              $ 7,176,063
               1998 ............                2,865,068
               1999 ............                2,060,324

                                              $12,101,455
                                              ===========

Included in maturities  for the year ended March 31, 1996 are other demand notes
payable of $4,006,079.

All debt obligations,  except for other demand notes payable, are secured by the
pledge of specific mortgage notes receivable.

Maturities of SSCs and debt obligations are financed through principal  payments
received on mortgage loans,  advances on other demand notes payable and advances
on the  $10,000,000  line of credit which is expected to be renewed on an annual
basis.

Descriptions of the various categories of debt obligations follow:

SECURED SAVINGS CERTIFICATES

SSCs are issued in amounts of $1,000 or more and have single maturity dates from
30  days  to 10  years  from  date  of  issue.  With  respect  to an  individual
certificate, interest rate and frequency of payment of interest (either monthly,
quarterly,  semiannually,  annually  or at  maturity)  are  fixed at the time of
issuance of the certificate.  Effective July 18, 1994,  Church Loans decided not
to register and was not able to sell additional  SSCs after that date.  However,
during April 1995, the Board of Trust Managers  decided to register  $20,000,000
of SSCs on Form SB-2 and  during the  quarter  ended  December  31,  1995,  such
registration was effective and SSCs were being issued.

The certificates are secured under the terms of certain indentures that require,
among other things,  the pledge of mortgage notes  receivable  with total unpaid
principal  amounts not less than 100% or 125% of the aggregate  principal amount
of certain respective SSC registrations outstanding.  Due to the fluctuations in
the amount of sales of certificates as well as in the repayment of notes pledged
to secure the certificates,  Church Loans has on occasion failed to maintain the
required ratios of pledged notes to outstanding  certificates for a short period
of time until the deficiency could be corrected.  The indenture trustee has been
aware of these  temporary  technical  defaults  of Church  Loans and has  waived
declaration  of a default under the respective  Indenture.  As of March 31, 1996
and 1995, Church Loans was in compliance with the requirement.

Church Loans has an agreement with Great Nation  Investment  Corporation  (Great
Nation)  whereby Great Nation will use its best efforts to sell SSCs  registered
by Church Loans. The agreement  provides that Church Loans will pay Great Nation
a commission on the basis of an annualized  rate equal to  three-fourths  of one
percent per annum of the face amount of each certificate sold by Great Nation.

LINE OF CREDIT PAYABLE TO BANK

The line of credit payable to bank consists of borrowings under a loan agreement
effective  through  September 1, 1996,  that provides for a $10,000,000  line of
credit  with a  commitment  fee of 1/4%  to 3/8%  per  annum  on the  unadvanced
portion.  The loan  agreement  requires  Church Loans to pledge  mortgage  loans
receivable  having unpaid  principal  balances with an aggregate  present value,
discounted at 1% over the prime rate (9.25% at March 31, 1996), of not less than
110% of all  indebtedness  owed to the bank.  Interest accrues at the prime rate
and is payable semiannually.

                       YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 1996 AND 1995

Additionally,  the line of credit  requires  that Church Loans' net worth not be
less than  $18,000,000 and its total  indebtedness  shall not exceed 150% of its
net worth. At March 31, 1996, Church Loans' total indebtedness was approximately
$19,900,000 less than the maximum amount permitted under the agreement. The line
of credit  agreement also limits demand notes payable to $4,000,000  ($2,000,000
in 1995).

DEMAND NOTES PAYABLE

The demand notes  payable bear  interest at 1% less than the prime rate (payable
monthly) and are unsecured (see note 6).


NOTE 3 - INCOME TAX PROVISION

Church Loans has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a real estate  investment
trust under the Code, Church Loans must, among other things, distribute at least
95% of its taxable income to its shareholders through dividends. Church Loans is
required to pay  dividends  of at least 85% of its calendar  year  undistributed
income by February 1 or be subject to a special  federal excise tax of 4% on the
undistributed amount.

Deferred  taxes were not  significant  to Church Loans' 1996 and 1995  financial
statements.

Total  income tax  expense  for the years  ended March 31, 1996 and 1995 is less
than the amount computed by applying the applicable statutory federal income tax
rate (35%) to income before provision for income taxes as follows:

                                                       1996       1995

                                                   =========  =========


NOTE 4 - NET INCOME PER SHARE

Net income per share of  beneficial  interest is based on the  weighted  average
number of shares  outstanding,  which was  7,007,402 for each of the years ended
March 31, 1996 and 1995.  There were no share  equivalents or other  potentially
dilutive securities outstanding during any of the periods presented.

NOTE 6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Other demand notes  payable at March 31, 1996 and 1995 included  notes  totaling
$1,482,250 and $706,577,  respectively,  which represent borrowings from related
parties.  The  notes  bear  interest  at 1% less  than  the  prime  rate and are
unsecured. Interest expense incurred on related party other demand notes payable
was not significant for 1996 or 1995.

Secured  savings  certificates  at March 31, 1996 and 1995 include  certificates
totaling  $485,692 and $665,375,  respectively,  which represent  liabilities to
related parties.  Interest  expense incurred on savings  certificates of related
parties was not significant for 1996 or 1995.

NOTE 7 -        DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
                INSTRUMENTS

The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial  instruments,  the results of applying  such methods and
assumptions to the financial  instruments and limitations inherent in fair value
estimates:

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The assets are considered  short-term  instruments for which the carrying amount
is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

MORTGAGE LOANS, INTERIM CONSTRUCTION LOANS AND CHURCH BONDS

Fair  values  are  estimated  for  portfolios  of loans with  similar  financial
characteristics.  Loans are  segregated  by type,  such as mortgage  and interim
construction  loans and church bonds.  Each loan  category is further  segmented
into  fixed  and  adjustable  rate  interest  terms.  For  variable-rate  loans,
primarily  interim  construction  loans,  that  reprice  frequently  and with no
significant  change in credit risk,  fair values are based on carrying  amounts.
The  fair  value  of  fixed-rate  mortgage  loans  and  bonds  is  estimated  by
discounting  the future cash flows  through  the  estimated  maturity  using the
current  rates at which  similar  loans would be made to borrowers  with similar
credit  ratings.  The estimate of maturity is based on Church Loans'  historical
experience with repayments for each loan classification,  modified, as required,
by an estimate of the effect of current  economic  and lending  conditions.  The
carrying  value of loans,  net of the allowance for loan losses was  $31,804,559
and the fair value of loans was approximately $33,164,000 at March 31, 1996.

NOTES PAYABLE AND LINE OF CREDIT

The fair value of notes payable and the line of credit are equal to the carrying
value as such liabilities are deemed to be short-term borrowings.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                       YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 1996 AND 1995


SECURED SAVINGS CERTIFICATES

The fair value of secured  savings  certificates  is  estimated  using the rates
currently offered for financial instruments of similar characteristics. At March
31, 1996, the carrying value of secured savings  certificates was $7,545,375 and
the fair value of secured savings certificates was approximately $7,549,000.

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

Generally,  Church Loans enters into  commitments to extend credit at adjustable
interest terms.  Accordingly,  the commitment amount is a reasonable estimate of
fair value.

LIMITATIONS

Fair value  estimates  are made at a specific  point in time,  based on relevant
market  information  and  information  about  the  financial  instrument.  These
estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering
for sale at one time Church  Loans'  entire  holdings of a particular  financial
instrument.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of Church Loans'
financial  instruments,  fair value  estimates are based on judgments  regarding
future   expected   loss   experience,   current   economic   conditions,   risk
characteristics  of various  financial  instruments,  and other  factors.  These
estimates  are  subjective  in nature and involve  uncertainties  and matters of
significant  judgment  and,  therefore,  cannot be  determined  with  precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.


NOTE 8 - QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS (UNAUDITED)

management,  include all adjustments  (consisting of normal recurring  accruals)
