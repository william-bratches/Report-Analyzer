PART 1

Item 1.	Business

Camelot Corporation ("Registrant" or "the Company") is inactive.
It was previously a holding company buts its subsidiaries have
been dissolved by its state of incorporation.  The fiscal year
ended April 30, 1999 the Company has no operations.  All previous
business operations have been discontinued.

The Company was incorporated in Colorado on September 5, 1975,
and completed a $500,000 public offering of its common stock in
March 1976.  The Company has made several acquisitions and
divestments of businesses (see Discontinued Activities -
Acquisition and Divestment History).  The Company was delisted
from NASDAQ's Small Cap Market on February 26, 1998.
Subsequently it was unable to raise additional capital required
to continue the trading activities of its operating subsidiaries.
Its principle subsidiary, Third Planet Publishing, Inc. sold all
rights, title and interests to its software and hardware products
on March 31, 1998 and has since been dissolved by the state of
Florida.  Its remaining operating subsidiary mrcdrom.com, inc.
liquidated its inventory and ceased trading in July, 1998.  In
July, 1998 all employees of Camelot and its subsidiaries were
terminated.  Its directors and officers have since provided
unpaid services on a part-time basis to the Company.

The Registrant is one of a number of similar blind pool companies
affiliated with Mr. Daniel Wettreich the President of the
Registrant.  The other companies are as follows:

Wincroft, Inc. ("Wincroft") was organized in the state of
Colorado in May 1980 as part of a quasi-reorganization of Colspan
Environmental Systems, and has made several acquisitions and
divestments of businesses unrelated to its present activities. It
has been a blind pool company since April 2000.Mr. Daniel
Wettreich is a Director and President of Wincroft and as at the
financial year ended March, 2001 had an indirect interest in
700,000 common stock of Wincroft representing 13.6%
of the issued and outstanding common stock of that company.
These shares are owned by Camelot Corporation of which company
Mr. Wettreich is a Director, and Mr. Wettreich has disclaimed any
beneficial interest in these shares.  The brother of
Mr. Wettreich, Mr. Mick Y. Wettreich owned 3,576,400 shares
representing 81.2% of the issued and outstanding common stock of
Wincroft.

Forme Capital, Inc. ("Forme") was incorporated in the state of
Delaware in December 1986,and has made several acquisitions and
divestments of businesses unrelated to its present activities.
It has been a blind pool company since April 2000.  Mr.
Daniel Wettreich is a Director and President of Forme and as at
the financial year ended April 2001 had an indirect interest in
292,857 common stock of Forme representing 9.67% of the issued
and outstanding common stock of that company.  These shares are
owned by the wife of Mr. Wettreich and he has disclaimed any
beneficial interest in these shares. The brother of Mr.
Wettreich, Mr. Mick Y. Wettreich owned 2,700,000 shares
representing 89.15% of the issued and outstanding
common stock of Forme.
 <PAGE>
Malex, Inc. ("Malex") was incorporated in the state of Delaware
in June 1987.  It has been a blind pool company since inception.
Mr. Daniel Wettreich is a Director and President of Malex and as
at the financial year ended April 2001 had an indirect interest
in 225,000 common stock of Malex representing 2.67% of the issued
and outstanding common stock of that company.  These shares are
owned by the wife of Mr. Wettreich and he has disclaimed all
beneficial interest in these shares. The brother of Mr.
Wettreich, Mr. Mick Y. Wettreich owned 7,781,490 shares
representing 92.64% of the issued and outstanding common stock of
Malex.

The Registrant has had no success in finding companies with which
to merge. During the past three years one blind pool company
eVentures Group, Inc ("eVentures") that was affiliated with Mr.
Wettreich was merged in September 1999 with another group of
companies that were affiliates of the Lamar Hunt family of
Dallas, Texas.  The basis on which the decision was taken to
merge those particular companies with eVentures was the opinion
of Mr. Daniel Wettreich the President and Director of eVentures
regarding primarily the quality of the businesses that were to be
merged and their potential for future growth, the quality of the
management of the to be merged entities, and the benefits that
could accrue to the shareholders of eVentures if the merger took
place.  The selection of which blind pool company affiliated with
Mr. Wettreich will be used for a merger in a given transaction is
arbitrary and is partly dependent on which blind pool company is
of interest to the potential merger partner. The Registrant has
no particular advantage as a blind pool company over any other
blind pool company affiliated with Mr. Wettreich, and
there can be no guarantee that a merger will take place, or if a
merger does take place that such merger will be successful or be
beneficial to the stockholders of the Registrant.

Discontinued Activities - Acquisition and Divestment History

The Company's activities were conducted through subsidiaries, all
of which are now discontinued or have been sold.  Third Planet
Publishing, Inc., ('Third Planet") (established in January 1995)
was a research and development company developing hardware
and software solutions for audio and video conferencing over the
Internet.  mrcdrom.com, inc. ("mrcdrom.com"), (established  in
March 1998) was an Internet catalog retailer of software.
Camelot Internet Access Services, Inc. ("CIAS"), (established in
June 1996) was a provider of Internet access services.  Alexander
Mark Investments (USA), Inc. ("AMI") (80% acquired in May 1997)
was a U.S. public holding company whose only investment
was a shareholding in Meteor Technology plc ("Meteor") a U.K.
public company.

Third Planet was a research and development company focusing on
the development of VideoTalk, a video conferencing system for the
Internet.  Approximately $7,000,000 was expended by Third Planet
in developing VideoTalk and its ancilliary software product
DigiPhone since inception.  VideoTalk was successfully
demonstrated at COMDEX in the later part of 1997.  However, a
lack of funds for marketing the product was experienced in 1998.
Following the Company's delisting from NASDAQ Small Cap Market in
February, 1998 Third Planet sold on March 31, 1998 all rights,
title and interest in VideoTalk and its ancilliary products to
Wincroft, Inc. a US public company traded on the OTC Bulletin
Board.

The consideration was $7,002,056 payable by the issuance of
5,000,000 Preferred Shares, Series A and 1,028,000 Common Shares
in Wincroft together with a $2,000,000 note.  Subsequently, on
June 29, 1998 the $2,000,000 note was converted into 2,000,000
Preferred Shares, Series B in Wincroft.
<PAGE>
The Company made other acquisitions as follows:

</TABLE>
These companies ceased doing business in July 1994, July 1994,
November 1993, November 1993, and May 1995, respectively.

On September 16, 1988, the Company acquired Stock Transfer
Company of America, Inc. ("STCA"), a transfer agent, for 6,666
newly issued common shares of the Company (post reverse split).
In connection with this transaction, Daniel Wettreich was
appointed a Director, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and
Jeanette Fitzgerald was appointed a Director.   On April 11,
1994, following a decision by the Directors of the Company to
discontinue financial services activities, STCA was sold to a
company affiliated with Mr. Wettreich for book value, $13,276.
(See Item 12.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions).

On March 2, 1990, the Company's subsidiary, Beecher Energy, Ltd.
("Beecher") was listed on the Vancouver Stock Exchange in an
initial public offering.  The Company sold its 69%
shareholdings in Beecher on July 6, 1994 for C$400,000, (US
$288,293).

In January 1991, the Company acquired for cash an 80% majority
interest in Forme Capital, Inc. ("Forme") a publicly traded real
estate company from the wife of Mr. Wettreich.  In September
1993, the Company sold to Forme two office properties and then
sold all its investment in Forme for cash (approximately $40,000)
to Mrs. Wettreich. These transactions were approved by the
shareholders of the Company at the Annual Meeting held on
February 15, 1994.

In July, 1993, Registrant acquired approximately 40% of the
issued share capital of Goldstar Video Corporation ("GVC"), a
video marketing company for a net price of $92,432.  Registrant
also made a $150,000 secured loan to GVC.  Further, Goldstar
Entertainment, Inc. ("GEI") a subsidiary of Registrant acquired
certain licenses and other assets from GVC for $375,000.
Thereafter Registrant's subsidiary Camelot Entertainment, Inc.
commenced business as a video marketing company.  On October 20,
1993, GVC filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code which was converted to Chapter 7 on February
4, 1994.  Registrant was not a controlling shareholder of GVC.
The Company's subsidiary Camelot Entertainment, Inc. filed under
Chapter 7 of the US Bankruptcy laws in January 1995.

In November 1995, Registrant appointed Firecrest Group plc a
public company, as exclusive distributor for DigiPhone in the
United Kingdom and Ireland in consideration for $1,950,575
payable by shares equal to approximately 10% of Firecrest.
("Digiphone Rights")  In March 1996 all relations with Firecrest
were terminated and Registrant sold all its shares in
Firecrest in market transactions.  Subsequently, Firecrest sold
its DigiPhone Rights to Meteor.  In July 1996, Registrant sold
the European rights to distribute DigiPhone to DigiPhone Europe
Ltd which became a subsidiary of Meteor.  The consideration was
5,000,000 British Pounds of loan stock which was subsequently converted into
Meteor shares.  In November 1996 Registrant sold the
international DigiPhone rights to Meteor for  1,000,000 British Pounds of loan
stock which subsequently was converted into Meteor shares.  In
May 1998, DigiPhone International, Ltd. a Meteor subsidiary,
became the exclusive marketing company for all Third Planet
products on a worldwide basis.
<PAGE>
In May 1997, Registrant acquired approximately 80% of AMI whose
principle asset was approximately 57% of Meteor.  The
consideration (post reverse split) payable to the seller,
Adina, Inc. ("Adina") was 892,015 Preferred Shares, Series J of
Registrant and 453,080 Preferred Shares, Series J in deferred
consideration.  Following the transaction Adina had 49% of the
voting rights attributable to the issued and outstanding common
and preferred shares of Registrant.  Mr. Wettreich is a director
of Adina and did not participate in any directors' votes in
relation to this transaction.

Registrant, through its acquisition of 80% of AMI in May 1997
obtained control of Meteor, a U.K. listed public company which
was subsequently renamed Constable Group plc.  Meteor's
two operational subsidiaries, were DigiPhone International Ltd.
and Meteor Payphones Ltd.  DigiPhone International was the
worldwide distributor for all products developed by Third
Planet and was sold to Registrant in January, 1998 for
cancellation of 500,000 British Pounds loan stock owed to Camelot by Meteor.
All rights owned by DigiPhone International were transferred to
Third Planet Publishing prior to the sale of VideoTalk to
Wincroft. Registrant sold all its shareholding in AMI for $38,063
on March 20, 1998. Meteor Payphones and its sister payphone
companies were placed into liquidation on 30th March 1998.
Constable Group plc (formerly Meteor Technology plc) was placed
into liquidation on 31st July 1998.

mrcdrom.com began operations in April, 1997 as an Internet
shopping company selling software titles over the World Wide Web.
It also announced the filing of a registration statement to raise
up to $12,000,000 through an initial public offering ("IPO") over
the Internet, however such registration was withdrawn and no
funds were raised.  mrcdrom.com had losses throughout its trading
history and due to the inability of Registrant to fund
such continuing losses ceased doing business in July, 1998,
liquidated all its inventory, and terminated all its employees.
The Company is now inactive.

Camelot Internet Access Services, Inc. was an Internet services
provider formed in January 1996 using the UUNet backbone.  This
subsidiary's principle activities were the provision of support
services for Registrant and the provision of Internet access to
users of DigiPhone who would otherwise be unable to access the
Internet.  The Company became inactive during 1997.

In February 1997, Registrant acquired from Meteor the U.S.A. and
Canadian rights to PCAMS software, a payphone contract and
management system originally developed for Meteor's payphone
subsidiary. The consideration was cancellation of 2,000,000 British Pounds
unsecured convertible loan stock owed by Meteor to Camelot, and
the issuance by Camelot of 3,238,400 restricted common shares of
Camelot. Management intended to utilize PCAMS software both by
offering such software to independent providers and by seeking
acquisitions of payphone businesses. Registrant's limited
resources precluded active marketing of this product and in March
1998 the product was sold back to Meteor for 70,000 British Pounds.

Employees

As of July 14, 1998, the Company ceased having any employees. Its
directors and officers have since provided unpaid services on a

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

Board of Directors and Stockholders
Camelot Corporation

I have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Camelot
Corporation as of April   30, 2001 and the related statements of
operations, accumulated deficit, and cash flows for the
two years then ended.   These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.   My responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
my audit I conducted my audit in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards in the United States of America.
Those standards   require that I plan and perform the audit to
obtain   reasonable   assurance   about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.    An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and   disclosures in   the   financial statements.   An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.   I believe   my
audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion.

In my opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial   position   of
Camelot Corporation as of April 30, 2001, and the results of
their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the years
ended April 30, 2001 and 2000, in conformity with   generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern.  As discussed
in Note 5 to the financial statements, the Company's significant
operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern.  The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty.

                          CAMELOT CORPORATION
                     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business Activity and Principles of Consolidation

The Company is now inactive and all its operating subsidiaries
have discontinued operations.  The Company was primarily engaged
in research and development of Internet software and hardware and
the retailing of computer software over the Internet.
Discontinued operations of subsidiaries were involved in selling
software products through retail stores located in the Dallas
metroplex, the provision of internet services, video marketing
and distribution, financial services,  real  estate rentals, and
oil and gas development.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.   Cash
equivalents are composed primarily  of investments in a money
market account.

Income (Loss) Per Share

Income (Loss) per common share is computed on the basis of the
weighted average number of  common  shares  outstanding during
the  respective  periods. Outstanding stock warrants, options and
preferred shares are excluded from the computations, as their
effect would be anti-dilutive.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method
under which deferred  tax  assets  and liabilities  are
determined  based  upon differences between financial and tax
basis of assets and liabilities.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value of financial instruments are estimated to approximate
the related book value, unless otherwise indicated, based on
market information available to the Company.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangible assets held and used in operations
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

Use of Estimates

In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles, management is required to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

F-7
<PAGE>


2.  INCOME TAXES

The Company had no current State or Federal income tax expense
for each of the years ended April 30, 2001 and 2000.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
difference between currently enacted tax rates.  Deferred tax
expense or benefit is the result of the changes in deferred tax
assets and liabilities.

Deferred income taxes arise principally from the temporary
differences between financial statement and income tax
recognition of allowance for doubtful accounts, note receivable
allowance, investment valuation adjustments, inventory reserve
and from net operating losses.

The components of deferred taxes at April 30, in the accompanying
balance sheets are summarized below:
<TABLE>
<S>                              <C>             <C>


                                       2001          2000

Note receivable allowance             680,000	    680,000
Capital loss carryforward              32,000  	     32,000
Net operating loss carryforward	   11,900,000    11,900,000
       Less valuation allowance   (12,900,000)  (12,900,000)
       Deferred tax asset-net     $       -      $        -
</TABLE>
At April 30, 2001, the Company has approximately $26,000,000 of
unused Federal net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in
the years 2003 through 2013.

Approximately $640,000 of the net operating loss carryforwards
for tax purposes are limited due to statutory changes in the tax
law in connection with the change in more than 50% ownership of
the Company in 1988.  Because of statutory requirements in the
law, that portion of the  net operating loss carryforward
applicable to the period prior to the ownership change is limited
to use of approximately $35,800 per year until it expires.  As
the net operating losses expire, at a minimum, approximately
$425,000  of  the tax net operating loss carryforward will not be
available for the Company's future use.

3.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Preferred Stock

The Company has 100,000,000 authorized shares of $.01 par value
preferred stock with rights and preferences as designated by the

split or combination of each series of preferred shares and visa
versa.   Upon liquidation or dissolution of the Company, holders
of each series of preferred shares are entitled to receive, to
the extent of their par value, pro rata with other preferred
shareholders and before holders of common shares, all assets

Non-cumulative Preferred Stock  and  466,571  shares of  Series
C,  10%  Non-cumulative Preferred Stock.  The preferred shares
have no voting rights, pay dividends at the discretion of Forme's
board of directors, and have priority for payment upon
dissolution of Forme over Forme's common stock.  The Company
received dividends of $4,800 from Forme Capital during fiscal
year 1999.  During fiscal year 2000, the Company returned the
shares to Forme Capital for $5,812.

5. CONTINGENCIES

Litigation

During the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved
in legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries which management
does not expect to have a material effect on the financial
position of the Company.

Going Concern

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the company will continue as a going concern.  The company
has had recurring operating losses for the past several years and
is dependent upon financing to continue operations.  The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  It is management's
plan to find an operating company to merge with, thus creating
necessary operating revenue.

On July 1, 1995, Company entered into an employment contract with
