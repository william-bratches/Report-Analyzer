                                     PART I

ITEM  1.  BUSINESS
- ------------------

Tri-Valley Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is in the business of exploring,
acquiring and developing prospective and producing petroleum and precious metals
properties and interests therein.  Tri-Valley has two wholly owned subsidiaries,
Tri-Valley  Oil  & Gas Company ("TVOG") operates the oil & gas activities.  TVOG
derives  the  majority  of  its  revenue  from gas production.  Tri-Valley Power
Corporation  is  the other wholly owned subsidiary.  However, this subsidiary is
inactive at the present time.  The precious metals activity is operated directly
by  Tri-Valley  Corporation.

TVOG  primarily  generates its own exploration prospects from internal data, and
also  screens  submittals  from  other  geologists  and  companies.  TVOG enters
exploration  co-ventures from time to time with major industry companies such as
Phillips  Petroleum Company (Houston Regional Office), Occidental USA and Texaco
USA.  Typically,  TVOG  will  enter agreements to look for potential projects to
co-venture  with  another  major  oil company within a geographic area of mutual
interest ("AMI").  When TVOG proposes a potential project, or "play," within the
AMI,  it  offers  the play to its potential co-venturers.  The co-venturers must
then  accept  or  reject  up to 50% of the play under the terms of the agreement
involved,  within  a  limited  time  period.  TVOG  is  the  operator  of  these
co-ventures.

In  1987, the Company acquired precious metals claims on Alaska state lands. The
Company has conducted exploration operations on these properties and has reduced
its  original  claims  to  a  block  of  approximately 39,360 acres (61.5 square
miles).  The  Company has conducted trenching,  core drilling, bulk sampling and
assaying activities to date and has reason to believe that mineralization exists
to justify additional exploration and development activities.  However, to date,
the  Company  has  not  identified probable mineral reserves on these properties


ITEM  2.  PROPERTIES
- --------------------

The  Company's  headquarters and administrative offices are located at 230 South
Montclair  Street, Suite 101, Bakersfield, California 93309.  The Company leases
approximately 2,500 square feet of office space at that location.  The principal
properties  of  the  Company  consist  of  proven  and  unproven oil and gas and
precious  metal properties, maps and geologic records related to prospective oil
and  gas  and  precious  metal  properties,  office  and  other  equipment.

Oil  and  Gas  Operations
- -------------------------

The  oil  and  gas properties in which the Company holds interests are primarily
located  in  the area of central California known as the Sacramento Valley.  The
Company  also  leases  exploration  acreage  in  the San Joaquin and Santa Maria
Valleys.  The  Company  contracts for the drilling of all its wells and does not
own any drilling equipment, bulk storage facilities, transportation pipelines or
refineries.

The  company  has  retained  the  services  of Cecil Engineering, an independent
engineer,  for  the  purposes  of  estimating  the Company's net share of proved
developed  oil  and  gas reserves on all the Company's oil and gas properties at
December  31,  1999.  The  Company  does not include any undeveloped reserves in
these  reserve  studies  and,  accordingly,  only  proved developed reserves are
reported  herein.  Price  is  a  material  factor  in the stated reserves of the
Company,  because  higher  prices  permit  relatively higher-cost reserves to be
produced  economically.  Higher  prices  generally permit longer recovery, hence
larger  reserves  at  higher  values.  Conversely,  lower prices generally limit
recovery  to  lower-cost  reserves,  hence  smaller  reserves.  The  process  of
estimating  oil  and  gas reserve quantities is inherently imprecise.  Ascribing
monetary values to those reserves, therefore, yields imprecise estimated data at
best.

The  estimated future net recoverable oil and gas reserves from proved developed
properties as of December 31, 1999, December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997 were
as  follows:
                              BBL                   MCF

December  31,  1998             Condensate     234     Natural Gas     1,434,539
December  31,  1997             Condensate     224     Natural Gas     1,903,139



ITEM  2.  PROPERTIES
- --------------------

Using  year-end  oil  and  gas  prices  and  current  levels  of lease operating
expenses,  the  estimated  present value of the future net revenue to be derived
from the Company's proved developed oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10%, was
$1,308,178  at December 31, 1999, $1,213,400 at December 31, 1998,and $1,996,100
at  December  31,  1997.  Reference  is  made  to  the  unaudited  supplemental
information  of the consolidated financial statements for further information on
oil  and  gas  reserves  and  estimated  values.

The  following  table sets forth the net quantities of natural gas and crude oil
produced  by  Registrant  during:

As of December 31, 1999, the Company had the following gross and net position in
wells  and  developed  acreage:

          Wells  (1)                                   Acres  (2)

(1)     "Gross" wells represent the total number of producing wells in which the
Company has a working interest or overriding royalty.  "Net" wells represent the
number  of  gross  producing  wells multiplied by the percentages of the working
interests  and/or  royalty  interests  therein  by  the  Company.

(2)     "Gross"  acres  represent  the  total  acres  in which the Company has a
working  interest;  "net" acres represent the aggregate of the working interests
of  the  Company  in  the  gross  acres.

(3)     The  above  table,  regarding  net wells, recognizes only those wells in
which  the  Company  holds  an  overriding royalty interest or an earned working
interest.  Working  interests  to  be  earned  at payout have not been included.

The  following table sets forth the number of productive and dry exploratory and
development  wells  drilled  by  the  Company  during:

*Two  exploratory wells were drilled in 1998.  No determination has been made as
to  the  ability  to  commercially  produce  these  wells.

The  Company  deals with both industry and sophisticated individual investors on
its  oil  and  gas  projects.

The Company continually screens oil and gas prospects developed by the Company's
own  staff  and  by  other  sources  for  potential  leasing.

The  following  table  sets  forth information regarding undeveloped oil and gas
acreage  in  which  the  Company  had  an  interest  on  December  31,  1999.

                  State          Gross Acres          Net Acres
                  -----          -----------          ---------

                                               11,112
                           California          13,339

Some  of  the  Company's  undeveloped  acreage  is  held pursuant to leases from
landowners.  Such  leases  have  varying dates of execution and generally expire
one  to  five  years  after  the  date  of  the  lease.

Precious  Metals
- ----------------

The  precious  metals  properties  are  located  in  interior  Alaska.  They are
comprised  of  832  40-acre  claims,  of which 84 are leased from others, and 40
160-acre  prospecting sites, located solely on State open lands requiring annual
assessment  work,  and an annual per claim fee.  All fees are current.  However,
the Company reduced its claim block, in Alaska, subsequent to November 30, 1995,
to  concentrate  on  the  most  advanced  targets.

The  following  table  sets forth the information regarding the acreage position
the  Company  has  under  lease  in  Alaska  as  of  December  31,  1999:

                                              Net Acres
                                              ---------
                           State          Gross Acres
                           -----          -----------
                  Alaska          39,680.00          38,886.00

Mineral  properties claimed on Open State land require minimum annual assessment
work  of  $100  worth  per  State  of  Alaska claim.  The Company has no Federal
claims.  In 1998 and 1999, the Company conducted additional staking to bring its
present  land  position  to  approximately  33,000  acres  (61.5  square miles).
Expenditures  on  the  Richardson,  Alaska  acreage have already carried forward
annual  assessment  requirements  more  than  four  years  on  all  its  claims.




ITEM  2.  PROPERTIES
- --------------------

In  1991,  Tri-Valley  entered  into  an agreement with the Moscow based Central
Research  Institute  of  Geological  Prospecting  for  Base  and Precious Metals
("TsNIGRI")  to  demonstrate  their  proprietary technology for evaluating large
areas  of  covered  sub-arctic  terrain.  TsNIGRI  has performed over 1,000 line
miles  of  ground  traverses  for  geological,  geochemical,  biochemical,
hydrochemical  sampling  and  geophysical profiles throughout Tri-Valley's claim
block and surroundings.  More than 5,000 samples have been run through a variety
of  laboratory analysis including over 1,000 samples assayed by Bondar-Clegg, an
industry  accepted  assay  house.  Physical  gold has been found at 60 locations
wide  spread  over a 20 mile swath on the claims and TsNIGRI has increased their
forecast  to  over 2 million ounces of recoverable gold. Based on the results of
this  study  of  the  Company's  then  64  square  mile  lode  gold claim block,
Tri-Valley  management  believes  it  prudent  for continued development of this
precious  metals  segment  of  the  Company.

In  1998,  the  Company retained the services of M. J. Bright and Associates, an
independent  registered  geologist based in Denver, Colorado to analyze the data
from one core drill site and surrounding trench samples at the Democrat Dike, to
estimate  probable reserves.  M. J. Bright delineated 141,500 tons  grading 0.11
ounces  per  ton  (opt)  or about 15,000 ounces, beginning at surface to 80 feet
subsurface.  An additional 12,000 ounces is indicated from an additional 20 feet
depth of 108,500 tons also grading 0.11 opt. for a total of over 27,000 probable
ounces.  This occurs in an area approximately 1,200 feet long, 250 feet deep and
300  to  600 feet wide.  This represents approximately 12 million tons projected
to  grade  about 0.06 opt. for a possible resource of about 720,000 ounces.  The
Company is undertaking further review and exploration of the potential resources
in  this  area.

Management  believes  it  has demonstrated that the Company possesses a superior
mineral property which could reward the shareholders dramatically from discovery
success  with  little  downside  exposure  at  present.

Environmental
- -------------

The  Company's energy operations are subject to a number of regulations relating
to  environmental  protection,  as are all exploration and production companies.
However,  the  Company  believes it is in full compliance with all environmental
related  rules  and  regulations.


ITEM  3.  LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS
- ----------------------------

During the year ended 1997, the Company filed an action in Contra Costa Superior
Court  against  an  unrelated  Corporation  (defendant)  for breach of contract,
declaratory  relief,  breach of confidence, deceit, negligent misrepresentation,
interference  with  prospective  economic  advantage,  unfair  competition,  and
constructive  trust.  The  matter  proceeded  to  trial on January 19, 1999, and
resulted  in  a  judgement for defendants. The judgement was entered in favor of
defendants  on  July  26, 1999.  Thereafter, defendants filed a motion for their
attorney fees pursuant to California Civil Code. On December 21, 1999, the Court
issued  an  order  awarding  attorneys'  fees  to  defendants  in  the amount of
$370,367,  with  interest  accruing  at the statutory rate of 10% per annum from
December  1,  1999.  On  January  19,  2000, the Company filed its appeal of the
order.  While  the  final  outcome of this matter cannot be determined presently
with  certainty,  the Company believes it has meritorious grounds for appeal and
intends  to  vigorously  pursue the reversal of this order and therefore has not
recognized  a  liability  in the financial statements. An unfavorable outcome of
this  litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
position,  liquidity  and  results  of  operations.


ITEM  4.  SUBMISSION  OF  MATTERS  TO  A  VOTE  OF  SECURITY  HOLDERS
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

On  November  19,  1999,  the  Company  held  its  annual  meeting.  The matters
submitted  to a vote of the security holders included the election of directors,
an  amendment  to  the  Certificate  of  Incorporation to increase the number of
authorized  shares,  the  election  by the Company to be governed by  203 of the
Delaware  General  Corporation Laws, and an amendment to the Company's Incentive
Stock  Option  Plan  to  increase  the  number  of  authrorized  shares.  The
shareholders  elected  all  of the nominees for director who were recommended by
the  board.  They  adopted  the  proposals  to increase the number of authorized
shares

As of December 31, 1999, the Company estimates that its common stock was held by
approximately  2,000  shareholders of record in 40 states and at least 4 foreign
countries.

The  Company  historically has paid no dividends, and at this time does not plan
to  pay  any  dividends in the immediate future.  Rather, the Company strives to
add  share  value  through discovery success.  As of 3/06/00, the Company had 13
market  makers  for  our  stock.  In  1999,  trading volume exceeded 8.2 million
shares.

Recent  Sales  of  unregistered  Securities
- -------------------------------------------

During  1999  there were 18,000 shares issued at $0.50 each from the exercise of
stock  options  held  by three directors and one former employee.  Additionally,
175,000  shares were sold to individuals in private placement, 75,000 at a price
of  $0.50  per share and 100,000 at a price of $1.25 per share, all exempt under
Section  4(2)  of  the  Securities  Act  of  1933.

DESCRIPTION  OF  SECURITIES.
- ----------------------------

We are authorized to issue up to100 million shares of one class of Common Stock,
par  value  $0.001 per share, and 5 million shares of Preferred Stock, par value
$.001 per share.  On December 31, 1999, 19,301,248 shares of Common Stock and no
shares  of  Preferred  Stock  were  issued  and  outstanding.


Common  Stock
- -------------

Each  shareholder  of the Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share of
common  stock held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders.  The Company's
Certificate  of  Incorporation  precludes  cumulative  voting  in  elections  of
directors.  However,  because  the  Company  is  qualified  to  do  business  in
California  and its principal place of business and many of its shareholders are
in California, the Company must comply with certain provisions of the California
Corporations  Code  concerning the rights of shareholders.  Thus, the Company is
subject  to  Section  708  of  the  California  Corporations  Code,  permitting
shareholders  to  cumulate  their  votes  at  any election of directors.  In the
election  of  directors,  cumulative  voting  permits  each shareholder give one
candidate  a  number  of  votes  equal  to the number of directors to be elected
multiplied  by  the  number  of shares held by the shareholder, or to distribute
that  number  of votes among as many candidates as the shareholder sees fit.  No
shareholder  may  cumulate  votes  in  an  election  of  directors

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOLDER  MATTERS
- ---------------

unless  a  shareholder has given notice of the intention to cumulate votes prior
to  the  commencement  of  voting.  If  any  shareholder has given notice of the
intent to cumulate votes, then all shareholders may do so.  Shareholders have no
preemptive  rights  or  other  rights  to  subscribe  for  additional  shares.

Shareholders  have  no  conversion  rights,  redemption  rights, or sinking fund
provisions.  Shareholders  are  entitled  to receive dividends, when declared by
its board of directors, out of funds legally available therefore, subject to the
restrictions  set  forth  in  the  Delaware  Statutes.  If  the  Company were to
liquidate,  dissolve,  or  wind  up,  the  holders  of the Common Stock would be
entitled to receive, pro rata, the net assets of the Company remaining after the
Company satisfies its obligations with its creditors.  Under Article Eleventh of
its  Certificate  of  Incorporation,  the  Company  has eliminated the potential
liability  of  directors  to it, and is also required to indemnify its directors
against  any  liability  for monetary damages, to the extent allowed by Delaware
law.   All  outstanding shares of Common Stock are fully paid and not subject to
further  calls  or  assessments.


Preferred  Stock
- ----------------

We  are  authorized  to  issue up to five million shares of Preferred Stock, par
value  $0.001  per  share.  No  shares of Preferred Stock have been issued.  The
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company does not specify any powers, rights,
or  preferences  for  the  Preferred  Stock  other  than  the  Common  Stock.


Anti-Takeover  Provisions  -  the  Share  Purchase  Rights  Plan
- ----------------------------------------------------------------

At  our  annual meeting of the shareholders of the Company in November 1999, the
shareholders  voted  in  favor  amending  the  Certificate  of  Incorporation to
increase  the  shares  of Common Stock the Company is authorized to issue to 100
million  shares.  One reason for the increase was to permit the Board to adopt a
Share  Purchase Rights Plan.  After the shareholders approved the amendment, the
Board  adopted  the  rights  plan.

The  rights  in  the  Share  Purchase  Rights  Plan  are designed to protect and
maximize  the  value  of  the  outstanding equity interests in Tri-Valley in the
event  of  an  unsolicited  attempt by an acquirer to take over Tri-Valley, in a
manner  or  on  terms  not approved by the Board of Directors. Takeover attempts
frequently  include  coercive  tactics to deprive a company's board of directors
and  its  stockholders  of  any real opportunity to determine the destiny of the
company.  The  rights  were  declared  in order to deter these types of coercive
tactics, which, include a gradual accumulation of shares in the open market of a
15%  or  greater  position  to  be followed by a merger or a partial or two-tier
tender  offer  that  does  not  treat  all  stockholders  equally. These tactics
unfairly  pressure  stockholders,  squeeze  them out of their investment without
giving  them any real choice and deprive them of the full value of their shares.

Our Board of Directors believes that the rights represent a sound and reasonable
means  of  addressing  the  complex  issues  of  corporate policy created by the
current  takeover  environment.  However,  the  rights  may  have  the effect of
rendering  more  difficult  or discouraging an acquisition of  Tri-Valley deemed
undesirable by the Board of Directors. The rights may cause substantial dilution
to a person or group that attempts to acquire Tri-Valley on terms or in a manner
not  approved  by  our  Board  of  Directors.

Pursuant  to  the  Share Purchase Rights Plan, we will issue one preferred stock
share  purchase  right  for  each outstanding share of common stock.  Each right
entitles  the registered holder to purchase from the Company 1/100 of a share of
our preferred stock at a purchase price of $20 per share, subject to adjustment.
The  rights become exercisable after the lapse of either (i) 10 days following a
public  announcement  or  disclosure  that  a  person  or group of affiliated or
associated persons, or an acquiring person, has acquired beneficial ownership of
15%  or  more of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, or (ii) 10 business
days,  or  a  later  date  as may be determined by the Board prior to the time a
person  or  group  becomes an acquiring person, following the announcement of an
intention  to  make  a  tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which
would  result  in  a  person  or  group  becoming  an  acquiring  person.




ITEM  5.  MARKET  PRICE  OF  THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED  SECURITY
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOLDER  MATTERS

The  earlier of those dates is called the distribution date.  No person or group
will  be  an  acquiring  person  if  the board determines in good faith that the
person  or  group  who  would  otherwise  be  an acquiring person has become one
inadvertently,  and that person or group promptly takes the actions necessary so
that  it  would  no  longer  be  considered  an  acquiring  person.

The  rights  will expire in December 2009, ten years after the Board adopted the
rights  plan,  unless the rights are redeemed earlier or unless the Board elects
to  extend  the  expiration  date.

The  number  of  outstanding  rights  and  the  number of shares of common stock
issuable  upon  the exercise of each right also will be subject to adjustment in
the event of a stock split of the Common Stock or a stock dividend on the Common
Stock payable in Common Stock or subdivisions, consolidations or combinations of
the  Common  Stock  occurring,  in  any  such case, prior to distribution of the
rights.

If  any  person  or  group becomes and acquiring person, each holder of a right,
other  than  the  acquiring person, will have the right to receive upon exercise
that  number  of  shares  of Common Stock having a market value of two times the
exercise  price  of  the  right  unless the event causing the person or group to
become  an  acquiring  person  is  a  merger,  acquisition  or  other  business
combination  described  in  the  next paragraph.  If we do not have a sufficient
amount  of  authorized Common Stock to satisfy the obligation to issue shares of
Common  Stock,  we must deliver upon payment of the exercise price of a right an
amount  of  cash or other securities equivalent in value to the shares of Common
Stock  issuable  upon  exercise  of  a  right.

If  any  person  or  group  becomes an acquiring person and (i) we merge into or
engage  in  certain  other  business  combination transactions with an acquiring
person, or (ii) 50% or more of out consolidated assets or earning power are sold
to  an acquiring person, each holder of a right, other than the acquiring person
will  have  the  right  to  receive that number of shares of Common Stock of the
acquiring company which will have a market value of two times the exercise price
of  the  right.

At  any  time  after  any  person  becomes an acquiring person and prior to that
person or group acquiring 50% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock,
the  Board  may  exchange  the  rights, other than rights owned by the acquiring
person,  at  an  exchange  ratio  of  one  share  of Common Stock, or 1/100 of a
preferred  share  per  right.

With  certain  exceptions,  no adjustment in the purchase price will be required
until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of a least 1% in the purchase
price.  No fractional preferred shares will be issued.  However, fractions which
are  integral  multiples  of 1/100 of a preferred share may, at our election, be
evidenced  by  depositary receipts.  In lieu of fractional shares, an adjustment
in  case  will  be based on the market price of the preferred shares on the last
trading  day  prior  to  the  date  of  exercise.

At any time prior to such time as a person or group becomes an acquiring person,
the  Board  may redeem all, but not some, of the rights at a price of $0.001 per
right.  The  redemption  of the rights may be made effective at the time, on the
basis and with any conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish.
After  the  period  for  redemption of the rights has expired, the Board may not
amend  the  rights  agreement to extend the period for redemption of the rights.
The  right  to exercise the rights terminates immediately when they are redeemed
and  the  only right of the holders of rights after that time will be to receive
the  redemption  price.

The  terms of the rights may be amended by a resolution of the Board without the
consent  of the holders of the rights.  However, from and after such time as any
person  or  group becomes an acquiring person, no amendment may adversely affect
the  interests  of  the  holders  of  the rights other than an acquiring person.

Until  a  right is exercised, the holder will have no rights as a stockholder of
the  Company,  including,  without  limitation,  the right to vote or to receive
dividends.

The  preferred  shares purchasable upon exercise of the rights, described above,
will  not  be  redeemable.  Each preferred share will be entitled to a quarterly
dividend  payment  of 100 times the dividend declared per share of Common Stock.
Each  preferred  share  will  have 100 votes, voting together with the shares of
Common Stock.  In the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in
which  shares  of  Common

A copy of the rights agreement that was adopted by the Board has been filed with
the Securities and Stock are exchanged, each preferred share will be entitled to
receive  100  times the amount received per share of Common Stock.  In the event
of liquidation, each preferred share will be entitled to a $1.00 preference, and
after  payment  of  the  preference, the holders of the preferred shares will be
entitled  to  an  aggregate  payment of 100 times the aggregate payment made per
share of Common Stock.  Because of the nature of the preferred shares' dividend,
liquidation  and  voting  rights, the value of the 1/100 interest in a preferred
share  purchasable  upon  exercise of each right should approximate the value of
the  one  share  of  Common  Stock.

Notice  Regarding  Forward-Looking  Statements

This  report  contains  forward-looking  statements.  The  words,  "anticipate,"
"believe,"  "expect,"  "plan,"  "intend," "estimate," "project," "could," "may,"
"foresee,"  and  similar  expressions  are  intended to identify forward-looking
statements.  These statements include information regarding expected development
of  the Company's business, lending activities, relationship with customers, and
development  in  the oil and gas industry.  Should one or more of these risks or
uncertainties  occur,  or  should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual
results  may  vary  materially  and  adversely from those anticipated, believed,
estimated  or  otherwise  indicated.


Computer  Uncertainties  for  the  Year  2000

The  Company  has  examined its computer software and it has not had any problem
with  the  "Year  2000"  issue  and  does  not  expect  any.


Natural  Gas  Activities

The Company generally sells a percentage of production on a fixed contract price
and  the  remainder  at  the  monthly spot price.  However, for 1999 the Company
believed  that  continued  weakness  in  the  oil  and gas sector would persist.
Therefore  the  Company  sold  100%  on  a  fixed price contract.  For 2000, the
Company's  contract  will  be  for  a  portion of a fixed contract price and the
balance  on  the  spot  market.

Our  hydrocarbon  reserves were valued by independent engineers at a net present
value  of  $1,217,299 at December 31, 1999, an increase of $38,954 from December
31,  1998 after taking into account the SEC mandatory 10% discount rate and also
taking  into consideration the effect of income tax.  This value does not appear
on  the balance sheet because accounting rules require discovered reserves to be
carried  on  the  balance  sheet  at  the cost of obtaining them rather than the
actual  future  net  revenue  from  producing  them.

Tri-Valley arranges to be carried in the test wells on prospects.  Therefore, it
incurs  very  little cost and very little value of discovered reserves appear on
the  balance  sheet despite the fact that reserves are a very important value to
the  Company,


Petroleum  Activities

The  main  activity of the Company during 1999 was operating its producing wells
and  reworking  a  well  that  had  been shut-in.  For the last three years, the
Company  has  successfully been leasing land for its EKHO Project.  In 1999, the
Company  raised  $9,500,000.00  dollars  for  this  project  and  began drilling
February  7,  2000  and  is  currently  drilling ahead to a target depth of over
19,000  feet.







ITEM  6.  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Precious  Metals  Activity

The  price  of  gold has fluctuated in the last 12 months from a high of $324.50
per  oz.  to  a  low  of  $253.00  per  oz.  However,  the  Company believes its
properties  contain deposits that can produce the gold at a cost that will still
allow  a  significant  profit.

On  March 22, 1999, Tri-Valley and Placer Dome U.S., Inc., executed a definitive
agreement for PDUS to explore, develop and mine approximately 36 square miles of
Tri-Valley's  50.5-square  mile  claim  block  at  Richardson,  Alaska.

Terms  of  the agreement call for PDUS to expend a minimum of US $6.5 million in
work on the property and partially reimburse Tri-Valley for some of its previous
exploration,  all  within  five years, in order for PDUS to earn 51% interest in
the property.  PDUS paid the Company $225,000 in 1999 and is required to pay the
Company  $200,000 in the year 2000 pursuant to this agreement.  PDUS may earn an
additional  29%  interest  by completing a bankable feasibility study on no less
than 750,000 ounces of gold and enacting a positive production decision on same.
Tri-Valley  estimates  such  a  study  could  cost  in  excess of US$10 million.

Tri-Valley  believes  the  PDUS exploration acreage hosts a massive gold-bearing
zone system related to the pluton underlying Buck Mountain and the Buckeye Creek
on  the  flank  where  samples grading high values of gold (1.5 opt), tellurium,
bismuth  and  tungsten  with  weaker  arsenic  values  were  found.

Tri-Valley  retained  approximately  14.5  square  miles  for  its  own account,
including  a  potentially high grade dike system and high grade creek as well as
placer rights over the entire 51.5 square miles of claims and prospecting sites.
During  1999,  Tri-Valley  added  10 square miles of claims to bring their claim
block  to  a  total  of  61.5  square  miles.


Telecommunications

In  May  of  1997,  the Company loaned the 3rd Mobil of Central New York general
partnership  $125,000  dollars,  which is secured by property, on a 6 month note
which  was subsequently extended for an additional period of time.  This note is
now  in  default and the Company is proceeding with foreclosure actions on these
secured  assets.


RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS

Comparison  of  Years  Ended  December  31,  1999  and  1998
- ------------------------------------------------------------
Balance  Sheet
- --------------

The  Company  had  $8,050,469  cash  on  hand  at  December 31, 1999 compared to
$191,226  as  of December 31, 1998.  This increase was the result of the Company
being advanced funds from the joint interest partners for their participation in
a well to be drilled during the year 2000.  Accounts receivable are down for the
year  ended  December  31, 1999 by $152,389 due to less drilling activity by the
Company  in 1999.  The Company has a note receivable for a loan the Company made
to the telecommunications partnership.  This loan is now in default and has been
reclassified  as  a  non-current  asset.  However,  the  Company  believes  the
collatteral  for  this loan is more than sufficient to satisfy this debt.  Trade
accounts payable are $191,429 less for the year ended December 31, 1999 from the
same  period  last  year  due  in  large  part  to  lack  of  drilling activity.


Revenues

Oil  and  Gas sales decreased to $522,591 for the period ended December 31, 1999
from  $833,380  for the year ended December 31, 1998.  This decrease of $310,789
was  due to declining production.  Interest income was down $32,353 due to fewer
funds  available  to  the company to invest in interest bearing accounts, as has
been the case in preceding years.  Other income was up $1,975,866, which was the
result



 ITEM  6.  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

of the sale of its Ekho No. 1 Project, which allowed the Company to recoup costs
it  had  expended  in  prior  years  to  put  this  project  together.


Costs  and  Expenses
- --------------------

Cost  and  expenses  were  up $677,030 from last year due in part to oil and gas
lease expenses increasing by $1,113,469 due to expenses related to the sale of a
well  project.  General  and  administrative  costs decreased $506,923 over last
year  primarily  due  to decreased legal expenses related to the lawsuit between
TVOG  and ABA Energy Corporation, et al.  See item 3. Legal Proceedings, page 5.
In  1999, the Company wrote off $148,334 of previously capitalized costs related
to  the  due  diligence  of  the telecommunications partnerships.  Depreciation,
depletion  and  amortization  expense  decreased  $55,009  due  to a decrease in
depletion  expenses  as  production  from  existing  wells continues to decline.

REPORT  OF  INDEPENDENT  AUDITOR'S


The  Board  of  Directors
Tri-Valley  Corporation
Bakersfield,  California


We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Tri-Valley
Corporation  as  of  December  31,  1999  and 1998, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the
years  then  ended.  These  financial  statements  are the responsibility of the
Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express an opinion on these
financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
used  in the United States which are not significantly different than those used
in  Canada.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan and perform the audits to
obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material  misstatement.  An  audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the  amounts  and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the overall financial statement
presentation.  We  believe  that  our  audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In  our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly in all material respects the financial position of Tri-Valley Corporation
at  December  31,  1999  and 1998, and the results of their operations and their
cash  flows  for  the  years  then  ended, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting  principles.

NOTE  1  -  SUMMARY  OF  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES
            ----------------------------------------------

This  summary  of  significant  accounting policies of Tri-Valley Corporation is
presented  to  assist  in  understanding the Company's financial statements. The
financial  statements and notes are representations of the Company's management,
which  is  responsible  for  their  integrity and objectivity.  These accounting
policies  conform  to  generally  accepted  accounting  principles and have been
consistently  applied  in  the  preparation  of  the  financial  statements.

Business  Combinations
- ----------------------

The  information contained in the financial statements and accompanying notes is
that of Tri-Valley Corporation with which the subsidiary company (Tri-Valley Oil
&  Gas  Co.)  has  been  consolidated.

Use  of  Estimates  in  the  Preparation  of  Financial  Statements
- -------------------------------------------------------------------

The  preparation  of  financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures at the date
of  the  financial  statements  as  well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses  during  the  reporting  period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Material  estimates  that  are  particularly  susceptible  to significant change
relate  to  the  estimate  of  Company  oil  and  gas  reserves  prepared  by an
independent  engineering  consultant.  Such  estimates  are  subject to numerous
uncertainties  inherent  in  the  estimation  of  quantities of proved reserves.
Estimated  reserves  are  used in the calculation of depletion, depreciation and
amortization  as  well  as  the  Company's  assessment  of  proved  oil  and gas
properties  for  impairment.

History  and  Business  Activity
- --------------------------------

Historically  an oil and gas exploration and production company, emphasizing the
Sacramento  Valley  natural  gas  province,  the  Company  added precious metals
exploration  in  fiscal year 1987. The Company conducts its oil and gas business
primarily  through its wholly owned oil and gas subsidiary, Tri-Valley Oil & Gas
Company ("TVOG"). TVOG is engaged in the exploration, acquisition and production
of  oil  and  gas  properties.  At  present,  the  precious  metals  exploration
activities are conducted directly by the parent, Tri-Valley Corporation ("TVC").
TVC  has  traditionally  sought  acquisition  or merger opportunities within and
outside  of  petroleum  and  mineral  industries.

NOTE  1  -  SUMMARY  OF  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (Continued)
            ----------------------------------------------

Basis  of  Accounting
- ---------------------

The  Company  prepares  its  financial  statements  using  the  accrual basis of
accounting  in  conformity with generally accepted accounting principles used in
the  United  States  consistently  applied.  These  principles  do not result in
significant  differences  from  those  used  in  Canada.  Oil and gas and mining
activities  are  recorded  using  the  successful  efforts method of accounting.

Substantially  all  of  the  Company's  exploration,  development and production
activities are conducted in the form of joint venture agreements with others and
accordingly,  the  financial statements reflect only the Company's proportionate
interest  in  these  joint  ventures.

Cash  Equivalent  and  Short-Term  Investments
- ----------------------------------------------

Cash  equivalents  include  cash  on hand and on deposit, and highly liquid debt
instruments  with  original  maturities  of  three  months  or  less.

Goodwill
- --------

The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  net  assets purchased of
Tri-Valley  Corporation's  wholly owned oil and gas subsidiary, TVOG. Net assets
are  carried  at  their fair market value at the acquisition date. The excess of
acquisition  costs over the fair value of assets acquired is included in and has
been  allocated  to  goodwill.  Goodwill  of  $433,853  is  being amortized on a
straight-line  basis over 40 years. The carrying amount of goodwill is evaluated
periodically.  Factors  used  in the evaluation include the Company's ability to
raise  capital as a public company and anticipated cash flows from operating and
non-operating  mineral properties. Tri-Valley Corporation has not established an
allowance  for  the  impairment  of  goodwill  which  may be realized should the
Company  be  acquired  or  merged  with  another  organization.

Acquisition  Costs
- ------------------

In  prior  years,  the  Company  capitalized  costs  as  a  part  of a potential
acquisition  of 26 wireless communication licenses held by five partnerships. As
discussed  in  Note  9,  the  licenses  and  equipment,  which  the  Company may
eventually  acquire,  are included in a security agreement as collateral between
the  debtor  and  the  Company.  During 1999, $148,334 of previously capitalized
acquisition  costs  were  considered  impaired.

Drilling  Agreements/Joint  Ventures
- ------------------------------------

Tri-Valley  frequently  participates  in  drilling agreements whereby it acts as
operator  of  drilling  and  producing  activities.  As  operator,  TVOG  is
contingently  liable  for  the activities of these ventures.  The Company owns a
carried  interest and/or overriding royalty interest in such ventures, earning a
working  interest  at  payout.

NOTE  1  -  SUMMARY  OF  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (Continued)
            ----------------------------------------------

Drilling  Agreements/Joint  Ventures  (Continued)
- ------------------------------------

Receivables  from and amounts payable to these related parties (as well as other
related  parties) have been segregated in the accompanying financial statements.
In  the  event the Company has expended funds for a project in an amount greater
than  the original contribution from investors, these costs offset advances from
other  projects  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  until  such  time as the
investors  contribute  more monies to fund these projects. The Company had three
projects  at  December  31, 1998, that had over expended funds in the amounts of
$552,179.  Transactions  with  these  parties  are within the ordinary course of
business.

Oil  and  Gas  Property  and  Equipment  (Successful  Efforts)
- --------------------------------------------------------------

The  Company  accounts  for its oil and gas exploration and development costs on
the  successful  efforts  method.  Under  this  method, costs to acquire mineral
interests  in  oil  and  gas properties, to drill and complete exploratory wells
that  find  proved  reserves  and  to  drill  and complete development wells are
capitalized.  Exploratory  dry-hole  costs, geological and geophysical costs and
costs  of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed when incurred.
Depletion, depreciation and amortization of oil and gas producing properties are
computed  on  an  aggregate  basis  using  the  units-of-production  method.

The  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB),  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  (SFAS)  No.  121,  "Accounting  for  the  Impairment  of
Long-Lived  Assets  and/or  Long-Lived  Assets to be Disposed of," requires that
long-lived  assets  be  reviewed  for  impairment  whenever events or changes in
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  may  not be
recoverable.  It  establishes guidelines for determining recoverability based on
future  net  cash flows from the use of the asset and for the measurement of the
impairment  loss.  Impairment  loss  under  SFAS  No.  121  is calculated as the
difference  between  the  carrying  amount  of the asset and its fair value. Any
impairment  loss  is  recorded  in  the  current period in which the recognition
criteria  are  first  applied  and  met.  Under the successful efforts method of
accounting  for  oil  and  gas operations, the Company periodically assesses its
proved  properties  for impairments by comparing the aggregate net book carrying
amount  of all proved properties with their aggregate future net cash flows. The
statement  requires  that the impairment review be performed on the lowest level
of  asset  groupings for which there are identifiable cash flows. In the case of
the  Company,  this  results  in  a  field  by  field  impairment  review.

Upon  the  sale  of  oil  and  gas  reserves  in  place,  costs less accumulated
amortization  of  such property are removed from the accounts and resulting gain
or loss on sale is reflected in operations.  Upon abandonment of properties, the
reserves are deemed fully depleted and any unamortized costs are recorded in the
statement  of  operations  under  leases  sold,  relinquished  and  impaired.

NOTE  1  -  SUMMARY  OF  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (Continued)
            ----------------------------------------------

Gold  Mineral  Property
- -----------------------

The  Company  has  invested  in  several  gold  mineral properties with economic
development  potential.  All mineral claim acquisition costs and exploration and
development  expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. The Securities and
Exchange  Commission  permits  capitalization  of  acquisition,  exploration and
development  costs  only  after  persuasive  engineering evidence is obtained to
support  recoverability  of  these  costs  (ideally upon determination of proven
and/or  probable  reserves  based  upon  dense  drilling samples and feasibility
studies  by  a  recognized  independent  engineer).  Although  the  Company  has
performed  drilling  samples,  and  an  independent engineer has deemed the gold
properties contain profitable reserves, management has chosen to follow the more
conservative  method of accounting by expensing gold mineral costs in the period
the  expense  is  incurred.

Properties  and  Equipment
- --------------------------

Properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the
following  estimated  useful  lives:

                                   Office furniture and fixtures     3 - 7 years
                                                           Building     40 years

Leasehold  improvements  are  amortized  over  the  life  of  the  lease.

Maintenance  and  repairs,  which  neither  materially  add  to the value of the
property  nor  appreciably prolong its life, are charged to expense as incurred.
Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment other than oil and gas
are  reflected  in  operations.

Concentration  of  Credit  Risk
- -------------------------------

The  Company  sells  oil,  gas  and  natural  gas liquids to various oil and gas
purchasers  primarily  in  the  northern  California region.  Credit is extended
based  on  an  evaluation  of  the customer's financial condition, and generally
collateral  is  not  required.

The  Company  places  its  temporary  cash  investments with high credit quality
financial  institutions  and  limits  the  amount  of credit exposure to any one
financial  institution.

Earnings  (Loss)  Per  Share  (SFAS  128)
- -----------------------------------------

Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (FASB), Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards  No.  128 (SFAS 128), "Earnings Per Share", was adopted by the Company
for  the  year  ended  December  31, 1997. SFAS 128 replaces the presentation of
primary earnings per share with a presentation of basic earnings per share based
upon  the  weighted  average  number  of  common  shares for the period. It also
requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share for companies
with complex structures. The effect of dilutive securities and stock options are
considered anti-dilutive and are not included in the computation of earnings per
share.

NOTE  4  -  RELATED  PARTY  TRANSACTIONS

Employee  Stock  Options
- ------------------------

The  Company  has a qualified and a nonqualified stock option plan which provide
for  the  granting  of  options  to  key employees, consultants, and nonemployee
directors  of the Company. The option price, number of shares and grant date are
determined  at  the  discretion  of  the  Company's  board of directors. Options
granted  under  the  plans are exercisable for a period also to be determined by
the  board  of  directors.

The  Company  has elected to account for the stock option plans under Accounting
Principles  Board  Opinion  No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued for Employees,"
and  related  interpretations.  Accordingly,  no  compensation  expense has been
recognized  for  the  stock  option  plans.

Had  compensation  expense for the stock plans been determined based on the fair
value  of  the  options  at  the  grant  date  consistent  with  the methodology
prescribed  under  Statement  of  Financial  Standards  No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation," the Company's net income would have been decreased by
$371,560  and  the  net income per common share would have decreased by $0.02 in
1999.  The  weighted  average  fair value of the options granted during 1999 was
estimated  using  the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  with the following
assumptions:

                    Grant Date     June 19,1999     September 1, 1999

NOTE  7  -  FINANCIAL  INFORMATION  RELATING  TO  INDUSTRY  SEGMENTS
            --------------------------------------------------------

The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and
Related  Information  in  1998  which  changes  the  way  the  Company  reports
information  about  its  operating  segments.

The  Company identifies reportable segments by product and country, although the
Company  currently  does not have foreign country segments. The Company includes
revenues  from both external customers and revenues from transactions with other
operating  segments  in  its measure of segment profit or loss. The Company also
includes interest revenue and expense, DD&A, and other operating expenses in its
measure  of  segment  profit  or  loss.

The  accounting  policies  of  the  reportable  segments  are  the same as those
described  in  the  Summary  of  Significant Accounting Principles (see Note 1).

The  Company's  operations  are classified into two principal industry segments.
Following  is  a  summary  of  segmented  information  for  1999  and  1998:

NOTE  9  -  COMMITMENTS  AND  CONTINGENCIES
            -------------------------------

Litigation
- ----------

During the year ended 1997, the Company filed an action in Contra Costa Superior
Court  against  an  unrelated  Corporation  (defendant)  for breach of contract,
declaratory  relief,  breach of confidence, deceit, negligent misrepresentation,
interference  with  prospective  economic  advantage,  unfair  competition,  and
constructive  trust.  The  matter  proceeded  to  trial on January 19, 1999, and
resulted  in  a  judgement for defendants. The judgement was entered in favor of
defendants  on  July  26, 1999.  Thereafter, defendants filed a motion for their
attorney fees pursuant to California Civil Code. On December 21, 1999, the Court
issued  an  order  awarding  attorneys'  fees  to  defendants  in  the amount of
$370,367,  with  interest  accruing  at the statutory rate of 10% per annum from
December  1,  1999.  On  January  19,  2000, the Company filed its appeal of the
order.  While  the  final  outcome of this matter cannot be determined presently
with  certainty,  the Company believes it has meritorious grounds for appeal and
intends  to  vigorously  pursue the reversal of this order and therefore has not
recognized  a  liability  in the financial statements. An unfavorable outcome of
this  litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
position,  liquidity  and  results  of  operations.

On  May  7,  1997, the Company executed a note receivable with 3rd Mobile in the
amount of $125,000, and a Security Agreement dated May 9, 1997 which secured the
note.  The  Security  Agreement  indicates  that  the  Company  holds a security
interest  in  all  assets and personal property of 3rd Mobile including, but not
limited  to,  all  accounts  receivable,  office  equipment,  automobiles,
communications towers and business facilities and equipment, customer lists, FCC
licenses  (known  and  unknown),  pending  customer  orders, and work product in
progress,  together  with the proceeds thereof (the Collateral).  The Collateral
secures the amounts due under the $125,000 note, including interest, in addition
to  all  costs  and  fees,  including  attorneys' fees, in regard to enforcement
against  the Collateral.  During 1998, the note receivable went into default. An
action  was  filed by the Company against 3rd Mobile on June 23, 1999 in the New
York  Supreme Court, Onondaga County to foreclose on the Collateral.  Subsequent
to June 23, 1999, the Company learned that the Collateral was included as listed
assets  of  Central  New  York  Mobile  Systems, L.C., whom had filed Chapter 11
bankruptcy in Sacramento, California.  The Company believes that it properly and
legally  secured its interest in the Collateral.  The Company has filed a motion
to  force the issue of ownership.  The motion is presently scheduled to be heard
on  March  29,  2000.

            -------------------------------

Mining  Activities
- ------------------

On  March  22,  1999,  the Company and Placer Dome U.S., Inc. (PDUS), executed a
definitive  agreement  for  PDUS  to  explore, develop and mine approximately 36
square  miles  of  the  Company's  50.5-square  mile  claim block at Richardson,
Alaska.  Terms  of  the  agreement  called  for PDUS to expend a minimum of $6.5
million  in work on the property and partially reimburse the Company for some of
its  previous  exploration, all within five years, in order for PDUS to earn 51%
interest in the property. PDUS may earn an additional 29% interest by completing
a  bankable  feasibility study on no less than 750,000 ounces of gold enacting a
positive  production  decision. The Company estimates such a study could cost in
excess of $10 million. The Company received payments from PDUS totaling $225,000
during  1999,  which  was  recorded  as  other  revenue. PDUS may terminate this
agreement  at  any  time.

Contingencies
- -------------

The Company is subject to possible loss contingencies pursuant to federal, state
and  local  environmental  laws  and  regulations.  These  include  existing and
potential  obligations  to  investigate  the  effects  of the release of certain
hydro-carbons  or  other  substances  at  various sites; to remediate or restore
these  sites; and to compensate others for damages and to make other payments as
required  by  law  or regulation. These obligations relate to sites owned by the
Company  or  others,  and  are  associated  with  past  and  present oil and gas
operations.  The  amount of such obligations is indeterminate and will depend on
such  factors  as  the  unknown  nature and extent of contamination, the unknown
timing,  extent  and  method  of  remedial  actions  which  may be required, the
determination  of  the  Company's  liability  in proportion to other responsible
parties,  and  the  state  of  the  law.

Leases
- ------

The  Company  leases  its  office  space  on  a  month  to  month  basis.

                             TRI-VALLEY CORPORATION
              SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ABOUT OIL AND GAS PRODUCING
                             ACTIVITIES (UNAUDITED)


The  following  estimates  of  proved  oil  and gas reserves, both developed and
undeveloped,  represent  interests  owned  by  the Company located solely in the
United  States.  Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and
natural  gas  which geological and engineering data demonstrate to be reasonably
certain  to  be  recoverable  in the future from known reservoirs under existing
economic  and  operating  conditions.  Proved developed oil and gas reserves are
reserves  that  can  be  expected  to  be recovered through existing wells, with
existing  equipment  and  operating  methods.  Proved  undeveloped  oil  and gas
reserves  are  reserves  that  are  expected  to  be recovered from new wells on
undrilled  acreage,  or  from  existing  wells  for  which  relatively  major
expenditures  are  required  for  completion.

Disclosures of oil and gas reserves which follow are based on estimates prepared
by  independent engineering consultants for the year ended December 31, 1999 and
1998.  Such  analyses  are  subject  to  numerous  uncertainties inherent in the
estimation  of  quantities  of  proved  reserves and in the projection of future
rates  of production and the timing of development expenditures. These estimates
do  not  include  probable  or  possible  reserves.

These  estimates are furnished and calculated in accordance with requirements of
the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  and  the  Securities  and Exchange
Commission  ("SEC").  Because of unpredictable variances in expenses and capital
forecasts,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  price changes, largely influenced and
controlled  by  U.S. and foreign government actions, and the fact that the basis
for  such  estimates  vary  significantly, management believes the usefulness of
these  projections  is  limited. Estimates of future net cash flows presented do
not  represent  management's  assessment  of future profitability or future cash
flows  to the Company. Management's investment and operating decisions are based
upon  reserve  estimates  that  include proved reserves prescribed by the SEC as
well  as  probable  reserves, and upon different price and cost assumptions from
those  used  here.

It  should be recognized that applying current costs and prices and a 10 percent
standard  discount  rate  does not convey absolute value. The discounted amounts
arrived  at  are  only  one  measure  of  the  value  of  proved  reserves.

Capitalized  costs  relating  to  oil  and  gas producing activities and related
accumulated  depletion,  depreciation  and  amortization  were  as  follows:

Standardized  measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and  gas  reserves
- ------------------

A  standardized  measure  of discounted future net cash flows is presented below
for  the  year  ended  December  31,  1999  and  1998.

The  future  net  cash  inflows  are  developed  as  follows:

     (1)     Estimates  are made of quantities of proved reserves and the future
periods during which they are expected to be produced based on year-end economic
conditions.
     (2)     The estimated future production of proved reserves is priced on the
basis  of  year-end  prices.
     (3)     The resulting future gross revenue streams are reduced by estimated
future  costs  to develop and to produce proved reserves, based on year end cost
estimates.
     (4)     The  resulting  future  net  revenue streams are reduced to present
value  amounts  by  applying  a  ten  percent  discount.

Disclosure  of  principal  components  of the standardized measure of discounted
future  net  cash  flows provides information concerning the factors involved in
making  the  calculation.  In  addition, the disclosure of both undiscounted and
discounted  net  cash  flows  provides a measure of comparing proved oil and gas
reserves  both  with  and  without  an  estimate  of  production  timing.  The
standardized  measure  of  discounted  future  net cash flows relating to proved
reserves  reflects  income  taxes.

Changes  in  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow from proved
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
reserve  quantities
- -------------------

This statement discloses the sources of changes in the standardized measure from
year  to  year.  The  amount  reported  as "Net changes in prices and production
costs"  represents  the  present value of changes in prices and production costs
multiplied by estimates of proved reserves as of the beginning of the year.  The
"accretion  of  discount"  was  computed by multiplying the ten percent discount
factor  by the standardized measure as of the beginning of the year.  The "Sales
of  oil and gas produced, net of production costs" is expressed in actual dollar
amounts.  "Revisions  of  previous  quantity estimates" is expressed at year-end
prices.  The  "Net  change in income taxes" is computed as the change in present
value  of  future  income  taxes.

                                   ARTICLE III
                                    DIRECTORS

     Section  1.  The Board of Directors has the authority to expand or contract

Directors need not be stockholders.  (As amended by the board of directors, June
28,  1985; July 19, 1997; November 19, 1999; and ratified by the shareholders at
the  annual  meeting  on  November  19,  1999).

increase  in  the  authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of
the  directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director,  and  the  directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual
election  and  until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless
sooner  displaced.  If  there  are  no  directors in office, then an election of
directors  may  be  held  in the manner provided by statute.  If, at the time of
filling  any  vacancy  or  any newly created directorship, the directors then in
office  shall constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted
immediately  prior  to  any  such  increase),  the  Court  of Chancery may, upon
application  of  any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten percent of
the  total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote
for  such  directors,  summarily  order  an election to be held to fill any such
vacancies  or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by
the  directors  then  in  office.

     Section 3. The business of the corporation shall be managed by its board of
directors  which may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such
lawful  acts  and  things  as  are  not  by  statute  or  by  the certificate of
incorporation  or  by these by-laws directed or required to be exercised or done
by  the  stockholders.

                       MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Section  4.  The  board  of directors of the corporation may hold meetings,
both  regular  and  special,  either  within  or  without the State of Delaware.

     Section 5. The first meeting of each newly elected board of directors shall
be held at such time and place as shall be fixed by the vote of the stockholders
at  the  annual  meeting and no notice of such meeting shall be necessary to the
newly  elected  directors in order legally to constitute the meeting, provided a
quorum shall be present.  In the event of the failure of the stockholders to fix
the time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected board of directors,
or  in  the event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the
stockholders,  the  meeting  may  be  held  at  such  time and place as shall be
specified  in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the
board  of  directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed by all
of  the  directors.

     Section  6.  Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without
notice  at  such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined
by  the  board.

     Section  7. Special meetings of the board may bo called by the president on
three  days'  notice  to  each  director,  either  personally  or  by mail or by
telegram; special meetings shall be called by the president or secretary in like
manner  and  on  like  notice  on  the  written  request  of  two  directors.

     Section  8.  At all meetings of the board a majority of the directors shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of
the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act
of  the  board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by
statute  or by the certificate of incorporation.  At each meeting, the directors
may  request  that  the  secretary  of  the Corporation be present to record the
minutes  of such meeting, or the directors may appoint a member of the board, or
such  other person as the board may direct, to act as secretary of such meeting.
If  a  quorum  is  not  present  at  any  meeting of the board of directors, the
directors  that  are  present may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without

                         EXHIBIT 99.1:  RIGHTS AGREEMENT
                         -------------------------------

     This  Rights  Agreement  (the  "Agreement"),  is hereby entered into by and
between  Tri-Valley  Corporation,  a  Delaware  corporation (the "Company"), and
Registrar  and  Transfer  Company,  as  Rights  Agent  (the  "Rights  Agent").

     The  board  of  directors  of  the  Company  (the "Board of Directors") has
authorized  and  declared a dividend of one common stock share purchase right (a
"Right")  for  each  Common Share (as that term is defined below) of the Company
that  is  outstanding  on  November  19,  1999  (the  "Record Date"), each Right
representing  the  right  to  purchase one Common Share of the Company, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, and has further authorized
and  directed the issuance of one Right with respect to each Common Share of the
Company  that  shall become outstanding between the Record Date and the earliest
of  the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date and the Final Expiration Date (as
such  terms  are  hereinafter  defined).

     Accordingly,  in  consideration  of  the premises and the mutual agreements
herein  set  forth,  the  parties  hereby  agree  as  follows:

     SECTION  1.  CERTAIN  DEFINITIONS.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement, the
following  terms  have  the  meanings  indicated:

     (a)  "Acquiring  Person"  shall mean any Person who or which, together with
all  Affiliates and Associates of such Person, shall be or become the Beneficial
Owner  of  15% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding, but
shall  not include (i) the Company, (ii) any Subsidiary of the Company, or (iii)
any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company, or
any  entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan.
Notwithstanding anything in this definition of Acquiring Person to the contrary,
no  Person shall become an "Acquiring Person" as the result of an acquisition of
Common  Shares  by  the  Company  which,  by  reducing  the  number  of  shares
outstanding,  increases the proportionate number of shares beneficially owned by
such Person to 15% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding;
provided,  however, that if a Person shall become the Beneficial Owner of 15% or
more  of  the  Common  Shares of the Company then outstanding by reason of share
purchases  by  the Company and shall, after such share purchases by the Company,
become the Beneficial Owner of any additional Common Shares of the Company, then
such  Person  shall  be  deemed  to  be  an  "Acquiring Person." Notwithstanding
anything in this definition of Acquiring Person to the contrary, if the Board of
Directors  determines  in  good  faith  that  a Person who would otherwise be an
"Acquiring  Person,"  as  defined  pursuant  to the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph  (a),  has  become  such  inadvertently,  and  such  Person divests as
promptly as practicable a sufficient number of Common Shares so that such Person
would  no  longer be an "Acquiring Person," as defined pursuant to the foregoing
provisions  of this paragraph (a), then such Person shall not be deemed to be an
"Acquiring  Person"  for  any  purposes  of  this  Agreement.

(b)  "Affiliate"  shall  have the meaning ascribed to such term in Rule 12b-2 of
the  General  Rules  and  Regulations under the Exchange Act as in effect on the
date  of  this  Agreement.

     (c)  "Associate" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in Rule 12b-2
of  the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act as in effect on the
date  of  this  Agreement.

     (d)  A Person shall be deemed the "Beneficial Owner" of and shall be deemed
to  "beneficially  own"  any  securities:

          (i) which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates
beneficially  owns,  directly  or  indirectly;

     (ii) which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates has
(A)  the right to acquire (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only
after  the  passage  of  time)  pursuant  to  any  agreement,  arrangement  or
understanding (other than customary agreements with and between underwriters and
selling  group  members  with  respect  to  a  bona  fide  public  offering  of
securities),  or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, rights
(other  than  these  Rights),  warrants  or  options,  or  otherwise;  provided,
however,  that  a  Person  shall  not  be  deemed the Beneficial Owner of, or to
beneficially  own,  securities  tendered  pursuant to a tender or exchange offer
made  by  or  on  behalf  of  such  Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or
Associates until such tendered securities are accepted for purchase or exchange;
or  (B)  the  right  to  vote,  or the right to direct the vote, pursuant to any
agreement,  arrangement  or  understanding;  provided,  however  , that a Person
shall  not  be  deemed  the  Beneficial  Owner  of,  or to beneficially own, any
security,  if the agreement, arrangement or understanding to vote, or direct the
vote  of,  such  security  (1)  arises  solely from a revocable proxy or consent
given  to such Person in response to a public proxy or consent solicitation made
pursuant  to,  and  in  accordance  with,  the  applicable rules and regulations
promulgated  under  the  Exchange  Act  and  (2)  is not also then reportable on
Schedule  13D under the Exchange Act (or any comparable or successor report); or

     (iii)  which  are  beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any other
Person  with  which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates
has any agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than customary agreements
with  and between underwriters and selling  group members with respect to a bona
fide  public  offering  of  securities)  for  the purpose of acquiring, holding,
voting (except to the extent contemplated by the proviso to Section 1(d)(ii)(B))
or  disposing of any securities of the Company. Notwithstanding anything in this
definition  of  Beneficial  Ownership  to  the  contrary,  the  phrase  "then
outstanding",  when  used  with  reference to a Person's Beneficial Ownership of
securities  of the Company, shall mean the number of such securities then issued
and  outstanding  together  with the number of such securities not then actually
issued  and  outstanding  which  such Person would be deemed to own beneficially
hereunder.

     (e)  "Board  of  Directors"  shall  have  the  meaning  set  forth  above.

time, on such date; provided, however, that, if such date is not a Business Day,

shares  of  common  stock,  par  value $.001 per share, of the Company.  "Common
Shares" when used with reference to any Person other than the Company shall mean
the  capital  stock  (or equity interest) with the greatest voting power of such
other  Person  or,  if  such other Person is a Subsidiary of another Person, the
Person  or  Persons  which  ultimately  control  such  first-mentioned  Person.

hereof.

     (z) "Trading Day" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 11(d) hereof.

     SECTION  2.  APPOINTMENT  OF  RIGHTS AGENT. The Company hereby appoints the
Rights Agent to act as agent for the Company and the holders of the Rights (who,
in accordance with Section 3 hereof, shall, prior to the Distribution Date, also
be the holders of the Common Shares) in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereof,  and  the  Rights Agent hereby accepts such appointment. The Company may
from  time  to  time  appoint  such co-Rights Agents as it may deem necessary or
desirable.

     SECTION  3.  ISSUE  OF RIGHT CERTIFICATES. (a) Until the earlier of (i) the
tenth  day  after the Shares Acquisition Date or (ii) the tenth Business Day (or
such  later  date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior
to  such  time  as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date of the
commencement  by  any  Person  (other  than  the  Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company,  any  employee  benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the
Company, or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any
such  plan)  of,  or  of  the  first public announcement of the intention of any
Person  (other  than  the  Company,  any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee
benefit  plan  of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company, or any entity
holding  Common  Shares  for  or  pursuant  to  the  terms  of any such plan) to
commence,  a  tender or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in
any  Person  becoming  the  Beneficial  Owner  of  Common  Shares of the Company
aggregating  15%  or  more of the then outstanding Common Shares (the earlier of
such  dates being herein referred to as the "Distribution Date"), (x) the Rights
will  be  evidenced  (subject  to  the provisions of Section 3(b) hereof) by the
certificates  for  Common  Shares registered in the names of the holders thereof
(which  certificates  shall  also be deemed to be Right Certificates) and not by
separate  Right  Certificates,  and  (y) the right to receive Right Certificates
will  be transferable only in connection with the transfer of Common Shares.  As
soon  as  practicable  after the Distribution Date, the Company will prepare and
execute,  the  Rights Agent will countersign, and the Company will send or cause
to  be  sent  (and  the  Rights  Agent will, if requested, send) by first-class,
postage-prepaid  mail, to each record holder of Common Shares as of the Close of
Business  on  the  Distribution Date, at the address of such holder shown on the
records  of  the  Company,  a  Right  Certificate,  in substantially the form of
Exhibit  A  hereto (a "Right Certificate"), evidencing one Right for each Common
Share  so  held.  From  and  after  the  Distribution  Date,  the Rights will be
evidenced  solely  by  such  Right  Certificates.


<PAGE>
     (b)  On  the Record Date, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Company
will  send a copy of a Summary of Rights, in substantially the form of Exhibit B
hereto  (the "Summary of Rights"), by first-class, postage-prepaid mail, to each
record  holder  of Common Shares as of the Close of Business on the Record Date,
at  the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company. With respect
to  certificates  for Common Shares outstanding as of the Record Date, until the
Distribution  Date, the Rights will be evidenced by such certificates registered
in  the  names  of  the  holders  thereof together with a copy of the Summary of
Rights  attached  thereto.  Until  the  Distribution Date (or the earlier of the
Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date), the surrender for transfer of any
certificate  for Common Shares outstanding on the Record Date, with or without a
copy  of  the  Summary  of  Rights  attached  thereto, shall also constitute the
transfer  of  the  Rights associated with the Common Shares represented thereby.

     (c)  Certificates  for  Common  Shares which become outstanding (including,
without limitation, reacquired Common Shares referred to in the last sentence of
this  paragraph  (c))  after  the  Record  Date but prior to the earliest of the
Distribution  Date, the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date, shall have
impressed  on, printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to them the following
legend:

"This  certificate  also  evidences  and  entitles  the holder hereof to certain
rights  as  set  forth  in a Rights Agreement between Tri-Valley Corporation and
_______________________, dated as of November 19, 1999 (the "Rights Agreement"),
the  terms  of  which  are hereby incorporated herein by reference and a copy of
which  is  on file at the principal executive offices of Tri-Valley Corporation.
Under  certain  circumstances, as set forth in the Rights Agreement, such Rights
will  be  evidenced  by separate certificates and will no longer be evidenced by
this  certificate.  Tri-Valley  Corporation  will  mail  to  the  holder of this
certificate  a  copy  of  the Rights Agreement without charge after receipt of a
written  request  thereof.  Under  certain  circumstances,  as  set forth in the
Rights  Agreement,  Rights  issued to any Person who becomes an Acquiring Person
(as  defined  in  the  Rights  Agreement)  may  become  null  and  void."

     With  respect  to  such certificates containing the foregoing legend, until
the  Distribution Date, the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented
by  such  certificates  shall  be  evidenced by such certificates alone, and the
surrender  for  transfer  of  any  such  certificate  shall  also constitute the
transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented thereby. In
the  event  that  the  Company purchases or acquires any Common Shares after the
Record  Date but prior to the Distribution Date, any Rights associated with such
Common  Shares  shall  be deemed cancelled and retired so that the Company shall
not  be  entitled to exercise any Rights associated with the Common Shares which
are  no  longer  outstanding.


<PAGE>
     SECTION  4.  FORM  OF  RIGHT  CERTIFICATES. The Right Certificates (and the
forms  of  election to purchase Preferred Shares and of assignment to be printed
on  the reverse thereof) shall be substantially the same as Exhibit A hereto and
may have such marks of identification or designation and such legends, summaries
or  endorsements  printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are
not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, or as may be required to
comply  with  any  applicable  law  or with any rule or regulation made pursuant
thereto  or  with  any  rule  or  regulation  of any stock exchange or automated
quotation  system  on  which  the  Rights may from time to time be listed, or to
conform  to  usage.  Subject  to  the provisions of Section 22 hereof, the Right
Certificates shall entitle the holders thereof to purchase such number of Common
Shares  of  the  Company  as  shall be set forth therein at the price per Common
Share  set  forth  therein (the "Purchase Price"), but the number of such Common
Shares and the Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein.

     SECTION  5. COUNTERSIGNATURE AND REGISTRATION. The Right Certificates shall
be  executed  on  behalf  of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its Chief
Executive  Officer, its President, any of its Vice Presidents, or its Treasurer,
either  manually  or  by  facsimile  signature,  shall  have affixed thereto the
Company's seal or a facsimile thereof, and shall be attested by the Secretary or
an  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Company,  either  manually  or  by  facsimile
signature.  The Right Certificates shall be manually countersigned by the Rights
Agent  and  shall not be valid for any purpose unless countersigned. In case any
officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Right Certificates shall
cease  to  be  such officer of the Company before countersignature by the Rights
Agent  and  issuance  and  delivery  by  the  Company,  such Right Certificates,
nevertheless,  may be countersigned by the Rights Agent and issued and delivered
by  the  Company  with  the  same  force and effect as though the individual who
signed such Right Certificates had not ceased to be such officer of the Company;
and  any  Right  Certificate  may  be  signed  on  behalf  of the Company by any
individual  who,  at the actual date of the execution of such Right Certificate,
shall be a proper officer of the Company to sign such Right Certificate although
at  the date of the execution of this Agreement any such individual was not such
an  officer.

     Following  the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent will keep or cause to be
kept,  at its principal office, books for registration and transfer of the Right
Certificates  issued hereunder. Such books shall show the names and addresses of
the respective holders of the Right Certificates, the number of Rights evidenced
on  its face by each of the Right Certificates and the date of each of the Right
Certificates.


<PAGE>
     SECTION  6.  TRANSFER,  SPLIT  UP,  COMBINATION  AND  EXCHANGE  OF  RIGHT
CERTIFICATES;  MUTILATED,  DESTROYED, LOST OR STOLEN RIGHT CERTIFICATES. Subject
to  the provisions of Section 14 hereof, at any time after the Close of Business
on  the  Distribution  Date,  and  at  or  prior to the Close of Business on the
earlier  of  the  Redemption  Date  or  the  Final  Expiration  Date,  any Right
Certificate  or  Right  Certificates (other than Right Certificates representing
Rights  that  have become void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof or that have
been  exchanged  pursuant  to  Section  24 hereof) may be transferred, split up,
combined, or exchanged for another Right Certificate or other Right Certificates
entitling  the  registered  holder to purchase a like number of Common Shares as
the  Right  Certificate  or  Right  Certificates  surrendered then entitled such
holder  to  purchase.  Any  registered  holder  desiring  to transfer, split up,
combine  or exchange any Right Certificate or Right Certificates shall make such
request  in writing delivered to the Rights Agent, and shall surrender the Right
Certificate  or  Right  Certificates  to  be  transferred, split up, combined or
exchanged  at  the  principal  office  of the Rights Agent. Thereupon the Rights
Agent  shall  countersign  and  deliver  to  the Person entitled thereto a Right
Certificate  or  Right  Certificates,  as  the case may be, as so requested. The
Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental
charge  that  may  be  imposed  in  connection  with  any  transfer,  split  up,
combination  or  exchange  of  Right  Certificates.

     Upon  receipt  by  the  Company and the Rights Agent of evidence reasonably
satisfactory  to  them  of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Right
Certificate,  and,  in  case  of  loss,  theft  or  destruction, of indemnity or
security  reasonably  satisfactory  to  them,  and,  at  the  Company's request,
reimbursement  to  the  Company  and the Rights Agent of all reasonable expenses
incidental  thereto,  and upon surrender to the Rights Agent and cancellation of
the  Right  Certificate  if  mutilated,  the Company will make and deliver a new
Right  Certificate  of  like  tenor  to  the  Rights  Agent  for delivery to the
registered holder in lieu of the Right Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed or
mutilated.

     SECTION  7.  EXERCISE OF RIGHTS; PURCHASE PRICE; EXPIRATION DATE OF RIGHTS.
(a)  The  registered  holder  of  any  Right Certificate may exercise the Rights
evidenced thereby (except as otherwise provided herein), in whole or in part, at
any  time  after the Distribution Date, upon surrender of the Right Certificate,
with the form of election to purchase on the reverse side thereof duly executed,
to  the  Rights Agent at the principal office of the Rights Agent, together with
payment  of  the Purchase Price for each Common Share as to which the Rights are
exercised, at or prior to the earliest of (i) the Close of Business on September
30,  2009,  (the "Final Expiration Date"), (ii) the time at which the Rights are
redeemed  as provided in Section 23 hereof (the "Redemption Date"), or (iii) the
time  at  which  such  Rights  are  exchanged  as provided in Section 24 hereof.

     (b)  The  Purchase  Price for each Common Share purchasable pursuant to the
exercise  of  a  Right  shall  initially be $0.01 per Common Share, and shall be
subject  to adjustment from time to time as provided in Section 11 or 13 hereof,
and  shall  be  payable  in  lawful  money  of  the  United States of America in
accordance  with  paragraph  (c)  below.


<PAGE>
     (c)  Upon  receipt  of a Right Certificate representing exercisable Rights,
with  the  form of election to purchase duly executed, accompanied by payment of
the  Purchase  Price  for  the shares to be purchased and an amount equal to any
applicable  transfer  tax  required  to  be  paid  by  the  holder of such Right
Certificate  in  accordance  with Section 9 hereof by certified check, cashier's
check or money order payable to the order of the Company, the Rights Agent shall
thereupon  promptly  (i)  (A)  requisition from any transfer agent of the Common
Shares  certificates  for  the  number  of Common Shares to be purchased and the
Company hereby irrevocably authorizes any such transfer agent to comply with all
such  requests, or (B) requisition from the depositary agent depositary receipts
representing  such number of Common Shares as are to be purchased (in which case
certificates  for  the  Common  Shares  represented  by  such  receipts shall be
deposited by the transfer agent of the Common Shares with such depositary agent)
and  the  Company  hereby  directs  such  depositary  agent  to comply with such
request;  (ii) when appropriate, requisition from the Company the amount of cash
to  be  paid in lieu of issuance of fractional shares in accordance with Section
14  hereof;  (iii)  promptly  after  receipt  of such certificates or depositary
receipts,  cause the same to be delivered to or upon the order of the registered
holder  of  such  Right  Certificate, registered in such name or names as may be
designated  by  such  holder; and (iv) when appropriate, after receipt, promptly
deliver  such  cash  to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right
Certificate.

     (d)  In  case the registered holder of any Right Certificate shall exercise
less  than  all the Rights evidenced thereby, a new Right Certificate evidencing
Rights  equivalent  to  the  Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued by the
Rights  Agent  to the registered holder of such Right Certificate or to his duly
authorized  assigns,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  Section  14  hereof.

     SECTION  8.  CANCELLATION  AND DESTRUCTION OF RIGHT CERTIFICATES. All Right
Certificates  surrendered  for  the  purpose  of  exercise,  transfer, split up,
combination  or  exchange  shall, if surrendered to the Company or to any of its
agents,  be delivered to the Rights Agent for cancellation or in cancelled form,
or,  if  surrendered to the Rights Agent, shall be cancelled by it, and no Right
Certificates  shall  be  issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by
any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Company shall deliver to the Rights
Agent  for cancellation and retirement, and the Rights Agent shall so cancel and
retire,  any  other  Right  Certificate  purchased  or  acquired  by the Company
otherwise  than  upon  the  exercise thereof. The Rights Agent shall deliver all
cancelled Right Certificates to the Company, or shall, at the written request of
the Company, destroy such cancelled Right Certificates, and, in such case, shall
deliver  a  certificate  of  destruction  thereof  to  the  Company.

     SECTION  9. AVAILABILITY OF COMMON SHARES. The Company covenants and agrees
that  it  will cause to be reserved and kept available out of its authorized and
unissued  Common Shares or any Common Shares held in its treasury, the number of
Common  Shares  that  will  be  sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all
outstanding  Rights  in  accordance  with  Section  7. The Company covenants and
agrees  that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all
Common  Shares  delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery
of  the  certificates for such Common Shares (subject to payment of the Purchase
Price),  be  duly  and  validly  authorized  and  issued  and  fully  paid  and
nonassessable  shares.


<PAGE>
                 The  Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when
due  and  payable any and all federal and state transfer taxes and charges which
may  be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates
or  of  any  Common  Shares  upon the exercise of Rights. The Company shall not,
however,  be required to pay any transfer tax which may be payable in respect of
any  transfer  or  delivery of Right Certificates to a Person other than, or the
issuance  or  delivery  of  certificates  or  depositary receipts for the Common
Shares  in  a  name  other  than  that  of,  the  registered holder of the Right
Certificate evidencing Rights surrendered for exercise or to issue or to deliver
any  certificates  or depositary receipts for Common Shares upon the exercise of
any  Rights  until any such tax shall have been paid (any such tax being payable
by  the  holder  of such Right Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it
has  been  established to the Company's reasonable satisfaction that no such tax
is  due.

     SECTION  10.  COMMON  SHARES  RECORD  DATE.  Each  Person in whose name any
certificate  for  Common  Shares is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for
all  purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the Common Shares
represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which
the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of
the  Purchase  Price  (and  any  applicable  transfer taxes) was made; provided,
however, that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the
Common  Shares  transfer  books  of the Company are closed, such Person shall be
deemed  to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate
shall  be  dated,  the  next  succeeding Business Day on which the Common Shares
transfer  books  of  the  Company  are open. Prior to the exercise of the Rights
evidenced  thereby,  the  holder of a Right Certificate shall not be entitled to
any  rights  of  a  holder  of  Common  Shares  for  which  the  Rights shall be
exercisable,  including,  without  limitation,  the  right  to  vote, to receive
dividends or other distributions or to exercise any preemptive rights, and shall
not  be entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of the Company, except
as  provided  herein.

     SECTION  11.  ADJUSTMENT  OF  PURCHASE PRICE, NUMBER OF SHARES OR NUMBER OF
RIGHTS.  The  Purchase  Price, the number of Common Shares covered by each Right
and the number of Rights outstanding are subject to adjustment from time to time
as  provided  in  this  Section  11.

     (a)     (i)  In  the  event the Company shall at any time after the date of
this  Agreement  (A)  declare  a dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common
Shares, (B) subdivide the outstanding Common Shares, (C) combine the outstanding
Common  Shares into a smaller number of Common Shares or (D) issue any shares of
its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Shares (including any such
reclassification  in  connection  with  a  consolidation  or merger in which the
Company  is  the  continuing  or  surviving  corporation),  except  as otherwise
provided  in this Section 11(a), the Purchase Price in effect at the time of the
record  date  for  such  dividend  or of the effective date of such subdivision,
combination  or  reclassification,  and the number and kind of shares of capital
stock  issuable  on  such  date,  shall  be proportionately adjusted so that the
holder  of  any Right exercised after such time shall be entitled to receive the
aggregate  number  and  kind of shares of capital stock which, if such Right had
been  exercised  immediately  prior  to  such date and at a time when the Common
Shares  transfer  books  of the Company were open, he would have owned upon such
exercise  and  been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision,
combination  or  reclassification; provided, however, that in no event shall the
consideration  to  be  paid  upon  the  exercise  of  one Right be less than the
aggregate  par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon
exercise  of  one  Right.


<PAGE>
     (ii)  In the event that any Person shall become an Acquiring Person and the
Rights  shall  then  be outstanding, the Company shall not take any action which
would  eliminate or diminish the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights.
From  and  after  the  occurrence  of  such  event,  any Rights that are or were
acquired  or  beneficially  owned  by  any Acquiring Person (or any Associate or
Affiliate  of such Acquiring Person) shall be void and any holder of such Rights
shall  thereafter  have  no right to exercise such Rights under any provision of
this  Agreement. No Right Certificate shall be issued pursuant to Section 3 that
represents  Rights  beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person whose Rights would
be  void  pursuant  to  the  preceding  sentence,  or any Associate or Affiliate
thereof;  no  Right Certificate shall be issued at any time upon the transfer of
any  Rights  to  an  Acquiring Person whose Rights would be void pursuant to the
preceding  sentence  or  any Associate or Affiliate thereof or to any nominee of
such  Acquiring  Person,  Associate  or  Affiliate;  and  any  Right Certificate
delivered  to  the Rights Agent for transfer to an Acquiring Person whose Rights
would  be  void  pursuant  to  the  preceding  sentence  shall  be  cancelled.

     (iii)  In the event that there shall not be sufficient Common Shares issued
but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit the exercise in full of
the  Rights  in  accordance with this agreement, the Company shall take all such
action  as  may  be necessary to authorize additional Common Shares for issuance
upon  exercise  of  the  Rights.

     (b) In case the Company shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights,
options  or warrants to all holders of Common Shares entitling them to subscribe
for  or purchase Common Shares or securities convertible into Common Shares at a
price  per  Common  Share (or having a conversion price per share, if a security
convertible  into  Common  Shares)  less  than the then current market price per
share  of  the  Common  Shares  on such record date, the Purchase Price to be in
effect  after  such  record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase
Price  in  effect  immediately  prior  to  such  record  date by a fraction, the
numerator  of  which  shall  be  the number of Common Shares outstanding on such
record  date plus the number of Common Shares which the aggregate offering price
of  the  total  number  of  Common Shares so to be offered (and/or the aggregate
initial  conversion  price of the convertible securities so to be offered) would
purchase  at such current market price and the denominator of which shall be the
number  of  Common  Shares  outstanding  on  such record date plus the number of
additional  Common  Shares  to  be offered for subscription or purchase (or into
which  the  convertible  securities so to be offered are initially convertible);
provided,  however, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the
exercise  of  one  Right  be  less than the aggregate par value of the shares of
capital  stock  of the Company issuable upon exercise of one Right. In case such
subscription  price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be
in  a  form  other  than  cash,  the  value  of  such  consideration shall be as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be
described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be binding on the
Rights  Agent  and holders of the Rights. Common Shares owned by or held for the
account  of  the  Company shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any
such  computation.  Such  adjustment  shall be made successively whenever such a
record date is fixed; and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are
not  so  issued,  the  Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price
which  would  then  be  in  effect  if  such  record  date  had  not been fixed.

 (c)  In  case  the  Company  shall  fix  a  record  date  for  the  making of a
distribution  to  all  holders  of  the  Common  Shares  (including  any  such
distribution  made  in  connection  with  a consolidation or merger in which the
Company is the continuing or surviving corporation) of evidences of indebtedness
or assets (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend or a dividend payable in
Common  Shares)  or subscription rights or warrants (excluding those referred to
in  Section  11(b) hereof), the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record
date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately
prior  to  such  record  date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
then  current  market  price per share of the Common Shares on such record date,
less  the  fair  market  value  (as  determined  in  good  faith by the Board of
Directors,  whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the
Rights Agent and shall be binding on the Rights Agent and holders of the Rights)
of  the  portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so to be distributed
or  of  such  subscription rights or warrants applicable to one Common Share and
the  denominator  of  which  shall be such current market price per share of the
Common Shares; provided, however, that in no event shall the consideration to be
paid  upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the
shares  of capital stock of the Company to be issued upon exercise of one Right.
Such  adjustments  shall  be  made  successively  whenever such a record date is
fixed;  and  in  the  event  that such distribution is not so made, the Purchase
Price  shall  again  be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in
effect  if  such  record  date  had  not  been  fixed.

      (d) For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the current market price
per  share  of any security (a "Security" for the purpose of this Section 11(d))
on  any  date  shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per
share  of such Security for the 30 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to
such  date. The closing price for each day shall be the last sale price, regular
way,  or,  in  case  no  such  sale  takes place on such day, the average of the
closing  bid  and  asked prices, regular way, in either case, as reported in the
principal  consolidated  transaction reporting system with respect to securities
listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Security
is not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported
in  the  principal  consolidated  transaction  reporting  system with respect to
securities  listed  on  the  principal national securities exchange on which the
Security  is  listed or admitted to trading or, if the Security is not listed or
admitted  to  trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price
or,  if  not  so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the
over-the-  counter  market,  as  reported  on the Nasdaq National Market or such
other  system then in use, or, if on any such date the Security is not quoted by
any  such  organization,  the  average  of  the  closing bid and asked prices as
furnished  by  a  professional  market  maker  making  a  market in the Security
selected  by  the Board of Directors. The term "Trading Day" shall mean a day on
which the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed
or  admitted  to  trading  is  open  for  the transaction of business or, if the
Security  is  not  listed  or  admitted  to  trading  on any national securities
exchange,  a  Business  Day.


<PAGE>
     (e)  No  adjustment  in  the  Purchase  Price shall be required unless such
adjustment  would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Purchase
Price;  provided,  however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section
11(e)  are  not  required  to  be  made  shall be carried forward and taken into
account  in  any  subsequent  adjustment. All calculations under this Section 11
shall  be  made  to  the  nearest cent or to the nearest one one-hundredths of a
Common  Share  or  one ten-thousandth of any other share or security as the case
may be. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 11(e), any adjustment
required by this Section 11 shall be made no later than the earlier of (i) three
years  from  the  date of the transaction which requires such adjustment or (ii)
the  date  of  the  expiration  of  the  right  to  exercise  any  Rights.

     (f)  If as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof,
the  holder  of  any Right thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive
any  shares of capital stock of the Company other than Common Shares, thereafter
the  number  of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of any Right shall
be  subject  to  adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly
equivalent  as  practicable  to the provisions with respect to the Common Shares
contained  in  Section  11(a)  through  (c),  inclusive,  and  the provisions of
Sections  7,  9, 10 and 13 with respect to the Common Shares shall apply on like
terms  to  any  such  other  shares.

     (g)  All  Rights  originally  issued  by  the  Company  subsequent  to  any
adjustment  made  to  the  Purchase  Price hereunder shall evidence the right to
purchase,  at  the  adjusted  Purchase  Price,  the  number  of  Common  Shares
purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the Rights, all subject
to  further  adjustment  as  provided  herein.

     (h)  Unless  the  Company  shall have exercised its election as provided in
Section  11(i),  upon  each  adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of the
calculations  made in Sections 11(b) and (c), each Right outstanding immediately
prior  to  the  making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to
purchase,  at  the  adjusted  Purchase  Price,  that  number  of  Common  Shares
(calculated to the nearest one one-hundredths of a Common Share) obtained by (A)
multiplying (x) the number of Common Shares covered by a Right immediately prior
to this adjustment by (y) the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such
adjustment of the Purchase Price and (B) dividing the product so obtained by the
Purchase  Price  in  effect  immediately  after  such adjustment of the Purchase
Price.


<PAGE>
     (i)  The  Company  may  elect on or after the date of any adjustment of the
Purchase Price to adjust the number of Rights in substitution for any adjustment
in the number of Common Shares purchasable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of
the  Rights  outstanding  after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be
exercisable  for  the  number of Common Shares for which a Right was exercisable
immediately  prior  to  such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such
adjustment  of  the  number  of  Rights  shall  become  that  number  of  Rights
(calculated to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase
Price  in  effect  immediately  prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the
Purchase Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Purchase Price. The
Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of
Rights,  indicating  the  record  date  for the adjustment, and, if known at the
time,  the amount of the adjustment to be made. This record date may be the date
on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right
Certificates  have been issued, shall be at least 10 days later than the date of
the  public  announcement.  If  Right  Certificates  have been issued, upon each
adjustment  of  the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(i), the Company
shall,  as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record
of Right Certificates on such record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject
to  Section  14  hereof,  the  additional  Rights to which such holders shall be
entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall
cause  to  be  distributed  to  such  holders  of  record  in  substitution  and
replacement for the Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of
adjustment,  and  upon  surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Right
Certificates  evidencing  all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled
after  such adjustment. Right Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued,
executed  and  countersigned  in  the  manner  provided  for herein and shall be
registered  in  the  names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the
record  date  specified  in  the  public  announcement.

     (j)  Irrespective  of any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price or the
number  of  Common  Shares  issuable  upon the exercise of the Rights, the Right
Certificates  theretofore  and  thereafter  issued  may  continue to express the
Purchase  Price  and  the  number  of  Common Shares which were expressed in the
initial  Right  Certificates  issued  hereunder.

     (k)  Before  taking  any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the
Purchase  Price  below the then par value, if any, of the Common Shares issuable
upon  exercise  of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action which
may,  in  the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may
validly  and  legally  issue  fully paid and nonassessable Common Shares at such
adjusted  Purchase  Price.

     (l)  In  any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an adjustment
in  the  Purchase  Price  be  made effective as of a record date for a specified
event,  the  Company  may  elect to defer until the occurrence of such event the
issuing  to  the  holder  of  any  Right exercised after such record date of the
Common  Shares  and  other  capital  stock or securities of the Company, if any,
issuable  upon  such exercise over and above the Common Shares and other capital
stock  or  securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the
basis  of  the  Purchase  Price  in  effect  prior to such adjustment; provided,
however,  that  the  Company  shall  deliver  to such holder a due bill or other
appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional
shares  upon  the  occurrence  of  the  event  requiring  such  adjustment.

     (m)  Anything  in  this  Section  11  to  the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company  shall  be  entitled  to  make such reductions in the Purchase Price, in
addition  to  those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to
the  extent  that it, in its sole discretion, shall determine to be advisable in
order  that  any  consolidation  or  subdivision  of the Common Shares, issuance
wholly  for  cash  of  any  Common Shares at less than the current market price,
issuance wholly for cash of Common Shares or securities which by their terms are
convertible  into  or exchangeable for Common Shares, dividends on Common Shares
payable  in Common Shares or issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to
hereinabove  in  Section  11(b), hereafter made by the Company to holders of its
Common  Shares  shall  not  be  taxable  to  such  stockholders.


<PAGE>
     (n)  In  the  event  that  at any time after the date of this Agreement and
prior  to  the  Distribution  Date,  the  Company  shall  (i) declare or pay any
dividend  on  the  Common  Shares  payable  in  Common  Shares, or (ii) effect a
subdivision,  combination  or  consolidation  of  the  Common  Shares  (by
reclassification  or  otherwise  than  by payment of dividends in Common Shares)
into  a greater or lesser number of Common Shares, then in any such case (A) the
number  of  Common  Shares  purchasable after such event upon proper exercise of
each  Right  shall  be  determined by multiplying the number of Common Shares so
purchasable  immediately  prior  to  such  event by a fraction, the numerator of
which  is  the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately before such event
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  number  of  Common Shares outstanding
immediately  after such event, and (B) each Common Share outstanding immediately
after  such  event  shall  have  issued with respect to it that number of Rights
which  each  Common Share outstanding immediately prior to such event had issued
with  respect to it. The adjustments provided for in this Section 11(n) shall be
made  successively  whenever  such  a  dividend  is  declared  or paid or such a
subdivision,  combination  or  consolidation  is  effected.

     SECTION  12.  CERTIFICATE  OF  ADJUSTED PURCHASE PRICE OR NUMBER OF SHARES.
Whenever  an  adjustment  is  made  as  provided in Section 11 or 13 hereof, the
Company  shall promptly (a) prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment,
and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment, (b) file with
the  Rights  Agent  and  with  each  transfer agent for the Common Shares or the
Common Shares a copy of such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to
each  holder  of  a  Right  Certificate  in  accordance  with Section 25 hereof.


<PAGE>
     SECTION  13. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER OR SALE OR TRANSFER OF ASSETS OR EARNING
POWER.  In  the  event,  directly  or indirectly, at any time after a Person has
become  an  Acquiring  Person,  (a) the Company shall consolidate with, or merge
with  and  into,  any  other  Person,  (b) any Person shall consolidate with the
Company,  or  merge  with  and  into  the  Company  and the Company shall be the
continuing  or surviving corporation of such merger and, in connection with such
merger,  all or part of the Common Shares shall be changed into or exchanged for
stock  or  other  securities of any other Person (or the Company) or cash or any
other  property,  or (c) the Company shall sell or otherwise transfer (or one or
more  of  its  Subsidiaries  shall  sell  or otherwise transfer), in one or more
transactions,  assets  or earning power aggregating 50% or more of the assets or
earning  power  of  the  Company  and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any
other  Person  other  than  the  Company  or  one  or  more  of its wholly owned
Subsidiaries,  then,  and  in  each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that  (i)  each  holder  of  a Right (except as otherwise provided herein) shall
thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at a price equal
to the then current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of Common Shares for
which  a  Right  is then exercisable, such number of Common Shares of such other
Person  (including  the  Company  as  successor  thereto  or  as  the  surviving
corporation)  as  shall  equal  the  result obtained by (A) multiplying the then
current  Purchase Price by the number of Common Shares for which a Right is then
exercisable  and  dividing  that  product  by (B) 50% of the then current market
price  per  share of the Common Shares of such other Person (determined pursuant
to  Section  11(d)  hereof)  on  the date of consummation of such consolidation,
merger, sale or transfer; (ii) the issuer of such Common Shares shall thereafter
be  liable  for, and shall assume, by virtue of such consolidation, merger, sale
or  transfer,  all  the  obligations  and duties of the Company pursuant to this
Agreement;  (iii) the term "Company" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such
issuer;  and  (iv) such issuer shall take such steps (including, but not limited
to,  the  reservation  of a sufficient number of its Common Shares in accordance
with  Section 9 hereof) in connection with such consummation as may be necessary
to  assure  that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly
as  reasonably  may  be, in relation to the Common Shares thereafter deliverable
upon  the  exercise  of  the  Rights.  The Company shall not consummate any such
consolidation,  merger,  sale  or  transfer unless prior thereto the Company and
such issuer shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental
agreement  so providing. The Company shall not enter into any transaction of the
kind referred to in this Section 13 if at the time of such transaction there are
any rights, warrants, instruments or securities outstanding or any agreements or
arrangements  which,  as a result of the consummation of such transaction, would
eliminate  or substantially diminish the benefits intended to be afforded by the
Rights.  The  provisions  of this Section 13 shall similarly apply to successive
mergers  or  consolidations  or  sales  or  other  transfers.

     SECTION  14. FRACTIONAL RIGHTS AND FRACTIONAL SHARES. (a) The Company shall
not be required to issue fractions of Rights or to distribute Right Certificates
which evidence fractional Rights. In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall
be paid to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which
such  fractional  Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to
the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Right. For the purposes
of  this  Section  14(a), the current market value of a whole Right shall be the
closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on
which  such  fractional  Rights  would have been otherwise issuable. The closing
price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such
sale  takes  place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices,
regular  way,  in  either  case,  as  reported  in  the  principal  consolidated
transaction  reporting  system  with respect to securities listed or admitted to
trading  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange or, if the Rights are not listed or
admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal
consolidated  transaction  reporting system with respect to securities listed on
the  principal  national  securities  exchange on which the Rights are listed or
admitted  to  trading or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on
any  national  securities  exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted,
the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market,
as  reported  on the Nasdaq National Market or such other system then in use or,
if  on  any  such  date  the Rights are not quoted by any such organization, the
average  of  the  closing  bid  and  asked prices as furnished by a professional
market  maker  making a market in the Rights selected by the Board of Directors.
If  on  any such date no such market maker is making a market in the Rights, the
fair  value  of the Rights on such date as determined in good faith by the Board
of  Directors  shall  be  used.


<PAGE>
     (b)  The  Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Common Shares
upon  exercise  of  the  Rights  or  to  distribute  certificates which evidence
fractional  Common  Shares.  In  lieu  of  fractional Common Shares, the Company
shall  pay  to  the  registered  holders  of Right Certificates at the time such
Rights  are  exercised  as  herein  provided an amount in cash equal to the same
fraction  of  the  current market value of one Common Share. For the purposes of
this  Section  14(b),  the  current  market value of a Common Share shall be the
closing price of a Common Share (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof)
for  the  Trading  Day  immediately  prior  to  the  date  of  such  exercise.

     (c)  The  holder of a Right by the acceptance of the Right expressly waives
his  right  to  receive  any  fractional  Rights  or  any fractional shares upon
exercise  of  a  Right  (except  as  provided  above).

     SECTION  15.  RIGHTS  OF  ACTION.  All  rights of action in respect of this
Agreement,  excepting  the  rights  of  action  given  to the Rights Agent under
Section  18 hereof, are vested in the respective registered holders of the Right
Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the registered holders of the
Common Shares); and any registered holder of any Right Certificate (or, prior to
the  Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), without the consent of the Rights
Agent  or  of  the  holder  of  any  other  Right  Certificate (or, prior to the
Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), may, in his own behalf and for his own
benefit,  enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding
against  the  Company  to  enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, his right to
exercise  the  Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate in the manner provided
in  such Right Certificate and in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing
or  any  remedies  available  to  the  holders  of  Rights,  it  is specifically
acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law
for any breach of this Agreement and will be entitled to specific performance of
the  obligations  under,  and  injunctive  relief  against  actual or threatened
violations  of  the  obligations  of  any  Person  subject  to  this  Agreement.

     SECTION  16.  AGREEMENT  OF  RIGHT  HOLDERS.  Every  holder  of a Right, by
accepting  the  same,  consents and agrees with the Company and the Rights Agent
and  with  every  other  holder  of  a  Right  that:

     (a) prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferable only in
connection  with  the  transfer  of  the  Common  Shares;

     (b)  after  the  Distribution Date, the Right Certificates are transferable
only  on  the registry books of the Rights Agent if surrendered at the principal
office  of the Rights Agent, duly endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument
of  transfer;  and

     (c) the Company and the Rights Agent may deem and treat the person in whose
name  the  Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, the associated
Common  Shares  certificate)  is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of
the  Rights  evidenced  thereby  (notwithstanding  any notations of ownership or
writing  on  the  Right  Certificate or the associated Common Shares certificate
made  by  anyone  other  than  the Company or the Rights Agent) for all purposes
whatsoever,  and  neither  the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by
any  notice  to  the  contrary.


<PAGE>
     SECTION  17.  RIGHT CERTIFICATE HOLDER NOT DEEMED A STOCKHOLDER. No holder,
as  such,  of any Right Certificate shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends
or  be  deemed  for  any  purpose  the  holder of the Common Shares or any other
securities  of  the Company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise of
the  Rights  represented  thereby, nor shall anything contained herein or in any
Right  Certificate  be  construed  to  confer  upon  the  holder  of  any  Right
Certificate,  as  such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any
right  to  vote  for  the  election of directors or upon any matter submitted to
stockholders  at  any  meeting  thereof,  or  to give or withhold consent to any
corporate  action,  or  to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting
stockholders  (except as provided in Section 25 hereof), or to receive dividends
or  subscription  rights,  or  otherwise, until the Right or Rights evidenced by
such  Right  Certificate  shall  have  been  exercised  in  accordance  with the
provisions  hereof.

     SECTION  18.  CONCERNING THE RIGHTS AGENT. The Company agrees to pay to the
Rights  Agent  reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder
and,  from  time to time, on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses
and  counsel  fees  and  other  disbursements incurred in the administration and
execution  of  this  Agreement  and  the  exercise and performance of its duties
hereunder.  The  Company  also  agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to
hold  it  harmless  against,  any  loss,  liability, or expense incurred without
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent, for
anything  done  or omitted by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance
and  administration  of  this  Agreement,  including  the  costs and expenses of
defending  against  any  claim  of  liability  in  the  premises.

                 The  Rights  Agent  shall  be  protected  and  shall  incur  no
liability  for,  or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in
connection with, its administration of this Agreement in reliance upon any Right
Certificate  or  certificate for the Common Shares or Common Shares or for other
securities  of  the  Company,  instrument  of  assignment  or transfer, power of
attorney,  endorsement,  affidavit,  letter,  notice,  direction,  consent,
certificate,  statement, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine
and  to  be  signed, executed and, where necessary, verified or acknowledged, by
the  proper  person  or  persons, or otherwise upon the advice of counsel as set
forth  in  Section  20  hereof.


<PAGE>
     SECTION  19. MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION OR CHANGE OF NAME OF RIGHTS AGENT. Any
corporation  into  which  the  Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may be
merged  or  with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from
any  merger  or  consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights
Agent  shall  be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the stock transfer or
corporate  trust powers of the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent, shall
be  the successor to the Rights Agent under this Agreement without the execution
or  filing  of  any  paper  or any further act on the part of any of the parties
hereto;  provided  that  such corporation would be eligible for appointment as a
successor Rights Agent under the provisions of Section 21 hereof. In case at the
time  such  successor  Rights  Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this
Agreement,  any  of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not
delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the
predecessor  Rights  Agent and deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned;
and,  in  case  at  that  time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been
countersigned,  any  successor  Rights  Agent  may  countersign  such  Right
Certificates  either  in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name
of  the  successor  Rights  Agent; and in all such cases such Right Certificates
shall  have  the  full  force  provided  in  the  Right Certificates and in this
Agreement.

     In  case  at  any time the name of the Rights Agent shall be changed and at
such  time  any  of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not
delivered,  the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name
and deliver Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of
the  Right  Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may
countersign  such  Right Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed
name;  and  in  all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force
provided  in  the  Right  Certificates  and  in  this  Agreement.

     SECTION  20. DUTIES OF RIGHTS AGENT. The Rights Agent undertakes the duties
and  obligations  imposed  by  this  Agreement  upon  the  following  terms  and
conditions,  by  all of which the Company and the holders of Right Certificates,
by  their  acceptance  thereof,  shall  be  bound:

     (a)  The  Rights  Agent  may  consult  with legal counsel (who may be legal
counsel  for  the  Company),  and  the opinion of such counsel shall be full and
complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to any action taken
or  omitted  by  it  in  good  faith  and  in  accordance  with  such  opinion.

     (b)  Whenever  in  the  performance  of its duties under this Agreement the
Rights  Agent  shall  deem  it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be
proved  or  established  by  the Company prior to taking or suffering any action
hereunder,  such  fact  or  matter  (unless other evidence in respect thereof be
herein  specifically  prescribed)  may  be  deemed to be conclusively proved and
established by a certificate signed by any one of the Chairman of the Board, the
Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer or the
Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate
shall be full authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken or suffered
in good faith by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such
certificate.

     (c) The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder to the Company and any other
Person  only  for  its  own  negligence,  bad  faith  or  willful  misconduct.

     (d)  The  Rights  Agent  shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the
statements  of  fact  or  recitals  contained  in this Agreement or in the Right
Certificates  (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the
same,  but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been
made  by  the  Company  only.


<PAGE>
     (e)  The  Rights  Agent shall not be under any responsibility in respect of
the  validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the
due  execution  hereof  by  the  Rights  Agent) or in respect of the validity or
execution  of  any  Right Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor
shall  it  be  responsible  for  any  breach  by  the Company of any covenant or
condition  contained in this Agreement or in any Right Certificate; nor shall it
be responsible for any change in the exercisability of the Rights (including the
Rights  becoming  void  pursuant  to Section 11 hereof) or any adjustment in the
terms  of  the  Rights (including the manner, method or amount thereof) provided
for  in  Section  3,  11,  13, 23 or 24, or the ascertaining of the existence of
facts  that  would require any such change or adjustment (except with respect to
the  exercise of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates after actual notice that
such  change  or  adjustment  is required); nor shall it by any act hereunder be
deemed  to  make  any  representation  or  warranty  as  to the authorization or
reservation  of any Common Shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any
Right  Certificate  or  as  to  whether  any Common Shares will, when issued, be
validly  authorized  and  issued,  fully  paid  and  nonassessable.

     (f)  The  Company  agrees  that  it  will perform, execute, acknowledge and
deliver  or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such
further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required
by  the  Rights  Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of
the  provisions  of  this  Agreement.

     (g)  The  Rights  Agent  is  hereby  authorized  and  directed  to  accept
instructions  with  respect  to the performance of its duties hereunder from any
one  of  the  Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President,
any  Vice President, the Secretary or the Treasurer of the Company, and to apply
to  such  officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and
it  shall  not be liable for any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in
accordance  with  instructions  of  any  such officer or for any delay in acting
while  waiting  for  those  instructions.

     (h)  The Rights Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of
the  Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other securities
of  the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the
Company  may  be  interested,  or  contract with or lend money to the Company or
otherwise  act as fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this
Agreement.  Nothing  herein  shall  preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any
other  capacity  for  the  Company  or  for  any  other  legal  entity.

     (i)  The  Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers
hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or through
its  attorneys  or  agents,  and  the  Rights  Agent  shall not be answerable or
accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or
agents  or  for  any  loss  to the Company resulting from any such act, default,
neglect  or  misconduct, provided reasonable care was exercised in the selection
and  continued  employment  thereof.


<PAGE>
     SECTION  21.  CHANGE  OF  RIGHTS  AGENT.  The Rights Agent or any successor
Rights  Agent  may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement
upon 30 days' notice in writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent
of  the  Common  Shares or Common Shares by registered or certified mail, and to
the  holders  of  the  Right  Certificates  by first-class mail. The Company may
remove  the  Rights  Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon 30 days' notice in
writing,  mailed  to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may
be,  and  to  each  transfer  agent  of  the  Common  Shares or Common Shares by
registered  or  certified  mail, and to the holders of the Right Certificates by
first-class  mail.  If  the  Rights  Agent  shall  resign or be removed or shall
otherwise  become  incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint a successor to
the  Rights  Agent.  If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a
period  of  30  days  after  giving  notice of such removal or after it has been
notified  in  writing  of  such  resignation  or  incapacity by the resigning or
incapacitated  Rights  Agent or by the holder of a Right Certificate (who shall,
with  such  notice, submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the Company),
then  the  registered  holder of any Right Certificate may apply to any court of
competent  jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor
Rights  Agent,  whether  appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be a
corporation  organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or
of  the State of New York (or of any other state of the United States so long as
such  corporation  is  authorized to do business as a banking institution in the
State of New York), in good standing, having an office in the State of New York,
which  is  authorized  under  such  laws  to  exercise  corporate trust or stock
transfer powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state
authority  and  which  has  at  the  time  of  its appointment as Rights Agent a
combined  capital  and  surplus  of at least $50 million. After appointment, the
successor  Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and
responsibilities  as  if  it  had  been originally named as Rights Agent without
further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer
to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and
execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for
the  purpose.  Not  later  than  the effective date of any such appointment, the
Company  shall  file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent
and each transfer agent of the Common Shares or Common Shares, and mail a notice
thereof  in writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates. Failure
to  give  any  notice  provided  for  in this Section 21, however, or any defect
therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal
of  the  Rights  Agent  or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the
case  may  be.

     SECTION  22. ISSUANCE OF NEW RIGHT CERTIFICATES. Notwithstanding any of the
provisions  of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may,
at  its  option,  issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as
may be approved by the Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in
the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares or other securities
or property purchasable under the Right Certificates made in accordance with the
provisions  of  this  Agreement.



<PAGE>
     SECTION  23.  REDEMPTION. (a) The Board of Directors may, at its option, at
any  time  prior  to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, redeem
all  but  not less than all of the then outstanding Rights at a redemption price
of  $.01  per  Right,  appropriately  adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock
dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such redemption
price  being  hereinafter referred to as the "Redemption Price"). The redemption
of  the  Rights by the Board of Directors may be made effective at such time, on
such  basis  and  with  such  conditions  as the Board of Directors, in its sole
discretion,  may  establish.

     (b)  Immediately  upon  the  action  of the Board of Directors ordering the
redemption  of  the  Rights  pursuant  to  paragraph (a) of this Section 23, and
without  any  further  action  and without any notice, the right to exercise the
Rights  will  terminate  and  the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights
shall be to receive the Redemption Price. The Company shall promptly give public
notice  of  any such redemption; provided, however, that the failure to give, or
any defect in, any such notice shall not affect the validity of such redemption.
Within  10  days  after  such  action  of  the  Board  of Directors ordering the
redemption  of  the Rights, the Company shall mail a notice of redemption to all
the  holders  of  the  then  outstanding  Rights at their last addresses as they
appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution
Date,  on  the  registry  books of the transfer agent for the Common Shares. Any
notice  which  is  mailed  in  the manner herein provided shall be deemed given,
whether  or  not  the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of redemption
will state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made.
Neither  the Company nor any of its Affiliates or Associates may redeem, acquire
or  purchase  for  value  any  Rights  at any time in any manner other than that
specifically  set  forth  in  this Section 23 or in Section 24 hereof, and other
than  in connection with the purchase of Common Shares prior to the Distribution
Date.

     SECTION 24. EXCHANGE. (a) The Board of Directors may, at its option, at any
time  after  any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the
then  outstanding  and  exercisable  Rights (which shall not include Rights that
have  become  void  pursuant  to the provisions of Section 11 hereof) for Common
Shares  at  an  exchange  ratio  of  one  Common  Share per Right, appropriately
adjusted  to  reflect  any  stock  split,  stock dividend or similar transaction
occurring  after the date hereof (such exchange ratio being hereinafter referred
to  as  the  "Exchange  Ratio").  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the Board of
Directors  shall  not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any
Person  (other  than  the  Company,  any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee
benefit  plan  of  the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company or any entity
holding  Common  Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan), together
with  all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner
of  50%  or  more  of  the  Common  Shares  then  outstanding.


<PAGE>
     (b)  Immediately  upon  the  action  of the Board of Directors ordering the
exchange  of any Rights pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 24 and without
any  further  action  and  without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights
shall  terminate  and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall
be  to  receive  that number of Common Shares equal to the number of such Rights
held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The Company shall promptly
give  public notice of any such exchange; provided, however, that the failure to
give,  or  any  defect  in,  such  notice  shall not affect the validity of such
exchange.  The  Company promptly shall mail a notice of any such exchange to all
of  the  holders  of such Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the
registry  books  of  the  Rights Agent. Any notice which is mailed in the manner
herein  provided  shall  be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the
notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange
of  the  Common  Shares  for  Rights  will  be effected and, in the event of any
partial  exchange,  the  number  of  Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial
exchange  shall  be  effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than
Rights  which  have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11 hereof)
held  by  each  holder  of  Rights.

     (c)  In  the  event that there shall not be sufficient Common Shares issued
but  not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit any exchange of Rights
as  contemplated  in accordance with this Section 24, the Company shall take all
such  action  as  may  be  necessary  to  authorize additional Common Shares for
issuance  upon  exchange  of  the  Rights.

     (d)  The  Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Common Shares
or  to  distribute certificates which evidence fractional Common Shares. In lieu
of  such  fractional  Common  Shares,  the  Company  shall pay to the registered
holders  of  the  Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Common
Shares  would otherwise be issuable an amount in cash equal to the same fraction
of  the  current  market value of a whole Common Share. For the purposes of this
paragraph  (d),  the  current  market value of a whole Common Share shall be the
closing price of a Common Share (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof)
for  the  Trading Day immediately prior to the date of exchange pursuant to this
Section  24.

     SECTION 25. NOTICE OF CERTAIN EVENTS. (a) In case the Company shall propose
(i)  to  pay  any  dividend  payable in stock of any class to the holders of its
Common  Shares  or  to  make any other distribution to the holders of its Common
Shares (other than a regular cash dividend), (ii) to offer to the holders of its
Common  Shares rights or warrants to subscribe for or to purchase any additional
Common Shares or shares of stock of any class or any other securities, rights or
options, (iii) to effect any reclassification of its Common Shares (other than a
reclassification  involving  only the subdivision of outstanding Common Shares),
(iv)  to  effect any consolidation or merger into or with, or to effect any sale
or  other  transfer  (or to permit one or more of its Subsidiaries to effect any
sale  or  other  transfer),  in  one or more transactions, of 50% or more of the
assets  or  earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole)
to,  any  other Person, (v) to effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of  the  Company,  or  (vi)  to declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares
payable  in  Common  Shares  or  to  effect  a  subdivision,  combination  or
consolidation  of  the  Common  Shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by
payment  of  dividends  in  Common Shares), then, in each such case, the Company
shall  give to each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26
hereof,  a  notice  of such proposed action, which shall specify the record date
for  the purposes of such stock dividend, or distribution of rights or warrants,
or  the  date  on  which  such  reclassification,  consolidation,  merger, sale,
transfer,  liquidation, dissolution, or winding up is to take place and the date
of  participation  therein  by  the  holders  of the Common Shares and/or Common
Shares,  if  any  such date is to be fixed, and such notice shall be so given in
the  case  of  any  action  covered by clause (i) or (ii) above at least 10 days
prior  to  the  record  date  for  determining  holders of the Common Shares for
purposes  of  such action, and in the case of any such other action, at least 10
days  prior  to  the  date  of the taking of such proposed action or the date of
participation  therein by the holders of the Common Shares and/or Common Shares,
whichever  shall  be  the  earlier.


<PAGE>
     (b)  In  case  the event set forth in Section 11(a)(ii) hereof shall occur,
then  the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter give to each holder of
a  Right  Certificate,  in  accordance  with  Section 26 hereof, a notice of the
occurrence  of  such  event,  which  notice  shall  describe  such event and the
consequences  of  such  event  to  holders  of  Rights  under Section 11 hereof.

                                    EXHIBIT B
                                    ---------

                          SUMMARY OF RIGHTS TO PURCHASE
                                  COMMON SHARES
                                  -------------

     Our  Board  of Directors believes that it is in Tri-Valley's best interests
to  adopt  a  Share Purchase Rights Plan (the "Rights Plan") which would make it
more  difficult  for another person or entity to engage in a hostile or unwanted
takeover of Tri-Valley and would provide an incentive to such a person or entity
to  negotiate  directly  with  the  Board  of  Directors instead of attempting a
hostile takeover.  The following description of the Rights Plan is intended as a
summary  only and is subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Rights
Agreement  (as  defined  below).

     Pursuant  to the Rights Plan, we will issue one common stock share purchase
right  (a  "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock.  Each Right will
entitle  the  registered holder to purchase from Tri-Valley one additional share
of  our  common  stock  at  a  price  of $0.01 per share (the "Purchase Price"),
subject to adjustment.  The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in
a  Rights  Agreement  (the "Rights Agreement"), between Tri-Valley and Registrar
and  Transfer  Company  as  Rights  Agent.  The Rights Agreement is on file with
Tri-Valley,  was  attached  as  an  exhibit  to  the  1999  Proxy  Statement for
Tri-Valley,  and  has  been  filed  with  the  SEC.

     We  will  not  issue  separate certificates representing the Rights until a
third party acquires or makes a tender offer or exchange offer to acquire 15% or
more  of our common stock.  Until one of those events occurs, the Rights will be
evidenced by the certificates already representing our common stock.  Until such
an  acquisition,  tender  offer  or  exchange offer occurs, (or until the Rights
expire), the Rights will be transferred with and only with our common stock, and
our  stock certificates will carry a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement
by  reference.

     Ten  business days after a third party or group makes a public announcement
that  they  have acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding
common  stock,  or  ten  days after a third party or group commences an exchange
offer  or  tender  offer  that  could  result in their owning 15% or more of our
outstanding common stock (or such later date as determined by our Board prior to
when  any  person  acquires  15%  or  more of our outstanding common stock), the
Rights  will  become  exercisable.  We  will  then  mail  separate  certificates
evidencing  the  Rights  to our common stockholders of record as of the close of
business  on  date  when  the  Rights  became  exercisable.

     When  the  Rights become exercisable B after a person or group acquires 15%
or  more  of  our  stock  B  the Rights will have the following characteristics:

1.     Each  holder  of  a  Right  (other  than Rights beneficially owned by the
person  or group that acquired the 15% interest) will have the right to exercise
their  Right  and  receive that number of shares of common stock having a market
value  of  two  times  the  exercise  price  of  the  Right.

2.     If  Tri-Valley  is  acquired  in  a  merger or other business combination
transaction,  or  if 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are
sold,  each  holder  of  a  Right  (other  than Rights beneficially owned by the
person  or  group that acquired the 15% interest) will thereafter have the right
to  receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then-current exercise price of the
Right,  that  number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at
the  time of such transaction will have a market value of two times the exercise
price  of  the  Right.

3.     After  the  person  or  group acquires their 15% interest but before they
acquire  50% or more of our outstanding stock, our Board may exchange the Rights
(other  than  Rights owned by the 15% interest holders, which have become void),
in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock per Right
(subject  to  adjustment).

4.     The  Rights  that  are  owned  beneficially  by  the  party or group that
acquired the 15% interest will become void and unexerciseable after they acquire
their  15%.

     The  Rights  will  expire  on  the 10th anniversary of the date of issuance
unless  we  extend  their  expiration  date  or unless we redeem or exchange the
Rights  prior  to  their  expiration  as  summarized  below.

     At  any  time before a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15%
or  more  of  our  outstanding  common stock, our Board may redeem the Rights in
whole,  but  not in part, at a price of $.01 per Right (the "Redemption Price").
The  redemption  of  the Rights may be made effective at such time on such basis
and  with  such  conditions as our Board, in its sole discretion, may establish.
Immediately  upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the rights
will terminate and the only right of the holders of the Rights will be that they
are  eligible  to  receive  the  Redemption  Price.

     The  terms of the Rights may be amended by our Board without the consent of
the  holders of the Rights; provided, however, that, from and after such time as
any  person  or  group  of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring
Person,  no  such amendment may adversely affect the interests of the holders of
the  Rights.

     Until  a  Right  is  exercised,  the  holder thereof, as such, will have no
rights  as  a  Tri-Valley  stockholder,  such as the right to vote or to receive
dividends.

     The  number  of outstanding Rights and the number of shares of common stock
issuable  upon  exercise of each Right also will be subject to adjustment in the
event  of  a  stock  split of the common stock or a stock dividend on the common
stock payable in common stock or subdivisions, consolidations or combinations of
the  common  stock  occurring,  in  any  such case, prior to distribution of the
Rights.

With  certain  exceptions,  no  adjustment in the Rights' Purchase Price will be
required  until  cumulative  adjustments  require  an adjustment of at least one
percent  in  such  Purchase Price.  No fractional shares of common stock will be
issued,  and  in  lieu  thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the
market  price  of  the common stock on the last trading day prior to the date of
exercise.

     The  Rights  have  certain  antitakeover  effects.  The  Rights  will cause
substantial  dilution  to  a person or group of persons that attempts to acquire
Tri-Valley  on  terms not approved by our Board. The Rights should not interfere
with any merger or other business combination approved by our Board prior to the
time  that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% percent or
more  of  the  common  stock  since  the  Rights  may  be  redeemed by us at the
Redemption  Price  until  such  time.
