                                     PART 1

Item 1.    Business
           --------

Camelot  Corporation  ("Registrant" or "the Company") is inactive,  and is now a
blind pool company  seeking  merger  opportunities.  It was previously a holding
company  but since the  fiscal  year ended  April 30,  1999 the  Company  has no
operations, and all previous business activities have been discontinued. All its
subsidiaries have been dissolved by its various states of incorporation.

The Company was  incorporated  in Colorado on September 5, 1975, and completed a
$500,000 public offering of its common stock in March 1976. The Company has made
several acquisitions and divestments of businesses (see Discontinued  Activities
- - Acquisition  and Divestment  History).  The Company was delisted from NASDAQ's
Small Cap Market on February 26, 1998.  Subsequently  it was unable to raise the
additional  capital  required  to  continue  the  activities  of  its  operating
subsidiaries.  Its principle subsidiary,  Third Planet Publishing, Inc. sold all
rights,  title and interests to its software and hardware  products on March 31,
1998 and has  since  been  dissolved  by the  state of  Florida.  Its  remaining
operating  subsidiary  mrcdrom.com,  inc.  liquidated  its  inventory and ceased
trading  in  July,  1998.  In  July,  1998  all  employees  of  Camelot  and its
subsidiaries  were  terminated.  Its directors and officers have since  provided
unpaid services on a part-time basis to the Company.

The  Registrant  is one of a number of similar blind pool  companies  affiliated
with Mr. Daniel  Wettreich the President of the Registrant.  The other companies
are as follows:

         Wincroft,  Inc.  ("Wincroft") was organized in the state of Colorado in
         May 1980 as part of a  quasi-reorganization  of  Colspan  Environmental
         Systems,   and  has  made  several   acquisitions  and  divestments  of
         businesses  unrelated  to its present  activities.  It has been a blind
         pool company since April  2000.Mr.  Daniel  Wettreich is a Director and
         President of Wincroft and as at the  financial  year ended March,  2005
         owned 3,576,400 shares representing 80.5% of the issued and outstanding
         common stock of Wincroft.

         Forme Capital, Inc. ("Forme") was incorporated in the state of Delaware
         in December  1986,and has made several  acquisitions and divestments of
         businesses  unrelated  to its present  activities.  It has been a blind
         pool company since April 2000.  Mr. Daniel  Wettreich is a Director and
         President of Forme and as at the financial  year ended April 2003 owned
         11,824,200  shares  representing  93.0% of the issued  and  outstanding
         common stock of Forme.

         Malex, Inc. ("Malex") was incorporated in the state of Delaware in June
         1987.  It has been a blind pool company  since  inception.  Mr.  Daniel
         Wettreich is a Director and  President of Malex and as at the financial
         year  ended  April  2005  owned  or had a non  beneficial  interest  in
         8,006,490  shares  representing  95.13% of the issued  and  outstanding
         common stock.

The  Registrant  has had no success in  finding  companies  with which to merge,
during the past three years.  The basis on which future  decisions to merge with
any blind pool company  associated with Mr.Daniel  Wettreich will be the opinion
of Mr.Wettreich regarding primarily the quality of the businesses that are to be
merged and their  potential for future  growth,the  quality of the management of
the  to  be  merged  entities,  and  the  benefits  that  could  accrue  to  the
shareholders of the blind pool company if the merger  occured.  The selection of
which blind pool company affiliated with Mr. Wettreich will be used for a merger
in a given  transaction is arbitrary and is partly dependent on which blind pool
company is of interest to the potential  merger  partner.  The Registrant has no
particular  advantage  as a blind pool company over any other blind pool company
affiliated with Mr. Wettreich,  and there can be no guarantee that a merger will
take place,  or if a merger does take place that such merger will be  successful
or be beneficial to the stockholders of the Registrant.

Discontinued Activities - Acquisition and Divestment History

The Company's activities were conducted through  subsidiaries,  all of which are
now  discontinued  or have been sold.  Third Planet  Publishing,  Inc.,  (`Third
Planet")  (established in January 1995) was a research and  development  company
developing hardware and software solutions for audio and video conferencing over
the Internet. mrcdrom.com, inc. ("mrcdrom.com"), (established in March 1998) was
an Internet catalog retailer of software. Camelot Internet Access Services, Inc.
("CIAS"), (established in June 1996) was a provider of Internet access services.
Alexander Mark Investments  (USA), Inc. ("AMI") (80% acquired in May 1997) was a
U.S.  public holding  company whose only investment was a shareholding in Meteor
Technology plc ("Meteor") a U.K. public company.

Third Planet was a research and development  company focusing on the development
of  VideoTalk,  a video  conferencing  system  for the  Internet.  Approximately
$7,000,000  was  expended  by  Third  Planet  in  developing  VideoTalk  and its
ancilliary   software   product   DigiPhone  since   inception.   VideoTalk  was
successfully  demonstrated at COMDEX in the later part of 1997.  However, a lack
of funds for  marketing  the  product was  experienced  in 1998.  Following  the
Company's delisting from NASDAQ Small Cap Market in February,  1998 Third Planet
sold on March 31,  1998 all rights,  title and  interest  in  VideoTalk  and its
ancilliary  products to  Wincroft,  Inc. a US public  company  traded on the OTC
Bulletin  Board.  The  consideration  was $7,002,056  payable by the issuance of
5,000,000  Preferred  Shares,  Series A and 1,028,000  Common Shares in Wincroft
together with a $2,000,000 note.  Subsequently,  on June 29, 1998 the $2,000,000
note was converted into 2,000,000 Preferred Shares, Series B in Wincroft.

The Company made other acquisitions as follows:

        Date                 Name                    Business            Cost
   --------------   ------------------------   ---------------------   --------

   March 1991       Vesta Land Title Company   Titles                  $120,000
   July 1991        Business Investigations    Investigations          $312,231
   July 1992        McKee-Blanchard            Appraisals              $ 32,203
   September 1992   First Appraisal Group      Appraisals              $ 15,000
   June 1994        Maxmedia Distributing      Software Distribution   $168,500

These companies  ceased doing business in July 1994,  July 1994,  November 1993,
November 1993, and May 1995, respectively.

On September 16, 1988, the Company  acquired Stock Transfer  Company of America,
Inc.  ("STCA"),  a transfer  agent,  for 6,666 newly issued common shares of the
Company  (post  reverse  split).  In connection  with this  transaction,  Daniel
Wettreich was  appointed a Director,  Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer and
Jeanette  Fitzgerald  was appointed a Director.  On April 11, 1994,  following a
decision by the  Directors  of the  Company to  discontinue  financial  services
activities,  STCA was sold to a company  affiliated with Mr.  Wettreich for book
value, $13,276. (See Item 12. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions).

On March 2, 1990, the Company's subsidiary, Beecher Energy, Ltd. ("Beecher") was
listed on the  Vancouver  Stock  Exchange  in an initial  public  offering.  The
Company sold its 69% shareholdings in Beecher on July 6, 1994 for C$400,000, (US
$288,293).

In January 1991, the Company acquired for cash an 80% majority interest in Forme
Capital,  Inc.  ("Forme") a publicly traded real estate company from the wife of
Mr.  Wettreich.  In  September  1993,  the  Company  sold to  Forme  two  office
properties  and then sold all its  investment  in Forme for cash  (approximately
$40,000) to Mrs. Wettreich. These transactions were approved by the shareholders
of the Company at the Annual Meeting held on February 15, 1994.

<PAGE>

In July, 1993, Registrant acquired approximately 40% of the issued share capital
of Goldstar Video Corporation ("GVC"), a video marketing company for a net price
of  $92,432.  Registrant  also made a  $150,000  secured  loan to GVC.  Further,
Goldstar Entertainment, Inc. ("GEI") a subsidiary of Registrant acquired certain
licenses  and  other  assets  from  GVC for  $375,000.  Thereafter  Registrant's
subsidiary Camelot  Entertainment,  Inc. commenced business as a video marketing
company.  On October 20, 1993,  GVC filed for protection  from  creditors  under
Chapter 11 of the  Bankruptcy  Code which was converted to Chapter 7 on February
4, 1994.  Registrant  was not a  controlling  shareholder  of GVC. The Company's
subsidiary  Camelot  Entertainment,  Inc.  filed  under  Chapter  7  of  the  US
Bankruptcy laws in January 1995.

In November 1995,  Registrant appointed Firecrest Group plc a public company, as
exclusive  distributor  for  DigiPhone  in the  United  Kingdom  and  Ireland in
consideration  for $1,950,575  payable by shares equal to  approximately  10% of
Firecrest.  ("Digiphone Rights") In March 1996 all relations with Firecrest were
terminated  and   Registrant   sold  all  its  shares  in  Firecrest  in  market
transactions.  Subsequently,  Firecrest sold its DigiPhone Rights to Meteor.  In
July 1996,  Registrant  sold the  European  rights to  distribute  DigiPhone  to
DigiPhone Europe Ltd which became a subsidiary of Meteor.  The consideration was
(pound)5,000,000  of loan stock  which was  subsequently  converted  into Meteor
shares. In November 1996 Registrant sold the  international  DigiPhone rights to
Meteor for  (pound)1,000,000 of loan stock which subsequently was converted into
Meteor shares. In May 1998, DigiPhone  International,  Ltd. a Meteor subsidiary,
became the  exclusive  marketing  company  for all Third  Planet  products  on a
worldwide basis.

In May 1997, Registrant acquired  approximately 80% of AMI whose principle asset
was approximately 57% of Meteor. The consideration  (post reverse split) payable
to the seller,  Adina, Inc. ("Adina") was 892,015 Preferred Shares,  Series J of
Registrant and 453,080  Preferred  Shares,  Series J in deferred  consideration.
Following the transaction Adina had 49% of the voting rights attributable to the
issued and outstanding common and preferred shares of Registrant.  Mr. Wettreich
was a  director  of Adina and did not  participate  in any  directors'  votes in
relation to this transaction.

Registrant,  through its acquisition of 80% of AMI in May 1997 obtained  control
of Meteor, a U.K. listed public company which was subsequently renamed Constable
Group plc. Meteor's two operational  subsidiaries,  were DigiPhone International
Ltd.  and  Meteor  Payphones  Ltd.  DigiPhone  International  was the  worldwide
distributor  for  all  products  developed  by  Third  Planet  and  was  sold to
Registrant in January,  1998 for cancellation of (pound)500,000  loan stock owed
to  Camelot  by  Meteor.  All  rights  owned  by  DigiPhone  International  were
transferred  to  Third  Planet  Publishing  prior to the  sale of  VideoTalk  to
Wincroft.  Registrant sold all its  shareholding in AMI for $38,063 on March 20,
1998.  Meteor  Payphones  and its sister  payphone  companies  were  placed into
liquidation on 30th March 1998.  Constable Group plc (formerly Meteor Technology
plc) was placed into liquidation on 31st July 1998.

mrcdrom.com  began  operations in April,  1997 as an Internet  shopping  company
selling software titles over the World Wide Web. It also announced the filing of
a registration  statement to raise up to  $12,000,000  through an initial public
offering ("IPO") over the Internet,  however such registration was withdrawn and
no funds were raised.  mrcdrom.com had losses throughout its trading history and
due to the inability of Registrant to fund such  continuing  losses ceased doing
business in July,  1998,  liquidated all its  inventory,  and terminated all its
employees.

Camelot Internet Access Services,  Inc. was an Internet services provider formed
in January 1996 using the UUNet backbone. This subsidiary's principle activities
were the  provision of support  services  for  Registrant  and the  provision of
Internet  access to users of DigiPhone  who would  otherwise be unable to access
the Internet. The Company became inactive during 1997.

<PAGE>

In February 1997, Registrant acquired from Meteor the U.S.A. and Canadian rights
to  PCAMS  software,  a  payphone  contract  and  management  system  originally
developed for Meteor's payphone  subsidiary.  The consideration was cancellation
of (pound)2,000,000  unsecured convertible loan stock owed by Meteor to Camelot,
and the issuance by Camelot of 3,238,400  restricted  common  shares of Camelot.
Management  intended to utilize PCAMS software both by offering such software to
independent  providers  and by  seeking  acquisitions  of  payphone  businesses.
Registrant's limited resources precluded active marketing of this product and in
March 1998 the product was sold back to Meteor for (pound)70,000.

Employees

As of July 14, 1998, the Company ceased having any employees.  Its directors and
officers have since provided  unpaid  services on a part-time basis as needed to
the Company.

           ----------

Company  previously  leased,  approximately  25,700 square feet of warehouse and
office space in  Carrollton,  Texas on a lease expiring on December 31, 2000. As
of July 24,  1998 this  lease was  terminated  by the  payment of $39,781 by the
Company to the landlord and the Company has no further liability under the terms
of the lease. The Company rents an accommodation  address in Dallas,  Texas on a
month to month basis for a nominal fee.


Item 3.    Legal Proceedings
           -----------------

Registrant has received a decision from the  Comptroller  of Public  Accounts of
the State of Texas  relating to a  Franchise  Tax  determination  for the period

             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Stockholders
Camelot Corporation

We  have  audited  the  accompanying   consolidated  balance  sheet  of  Camelot
Corporation  as of April 30,  2005 and the  related  statements  of  operations,
accumulated  deficit  and cash flows for the year then  ended.  These  financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audit.

We  conducted  our audit in  accordance  with  standards  of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  We believe our audit  provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all  material   respects,   the  consolidated   financial  position  of  Camelot
Corporation as of April 30, 2005 and the consolidated  results of its operations
and cash flows for the year then ended,  in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America.

The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been  prepared  assuming that the
Company  will  continue  as a  going  concern.  As  discussed  in  Note 4 to the
financial   statements,   the  Company's   significant  operating  losses  raise
substantial  doubt  about  its  ability  to  continue  as a going  concern.  The
financial  statements do not include any adjustments  that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.

                               CAMELOT CORPORATION
                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Business Activity and Principles of Consolidation

     The  Company  is now  inactive  and all  its  operating  subsidiaries  have
     discontinued operations.  The Company was primarily engaged in research and
     development of Internet software and hardware and the retailing of computer
     software over the Internet.  Discontinued  operations of subsidiaries  were
     involved in selling software  products through retail stores located in the
     Dallas metroplex,  the provision of internet services,  video marketing and
     distribution,  financial  services,  real estate  rentals,  and oil and gas
     development.

     Cash and Cash Equivalents

     The  Company   considers  all  highly  liquid   investments  with  original
     maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents
     are composed primarily of investments in a money market account.

     Income (Loss) Per Share

     Income  (Loss) per common  share is computed  on the basis of the  weighted
     average number of common shares outstanding during the respective  periods.
     Outstanding stock warrants,  options and preferred shares are excluded from
     the computations, as their effect would be anti-dilutive.

     Income Taxes

     Deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method under which
     deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined  based upon  differences
     between financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities.

     Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     Fair value of  financial  instruments  are  estimated  to  approximate  the
     related book value, unless otherwise indicated, based on market information
     available to the Company.

     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

     Impairment   losses  are   recorded  on   long-lived   assets  and  certain
     identifiable  intangible assets held and used in operations whenever events
     or changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
     may not be recoverable.

     Use of Estimates

     In preparing  financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
     accounting  principles,  management  is  required  to  make  estimates  and
     assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
     disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of the
     financial  statements,  and the  reported  amounts of revenues and expenses
     during  the  reporting  period.  Actual  results  could  differ  from those
     estimates.

     Recently issued accounting pronouncements

     In  November  2004,  the FASB  issued  SFAS No.  151,  "Inventory  Costs an
     amendment  of  ARB  No.  43,  Chapter  4."  This  Statement  clarifies  the
     accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
     costs,  and wasted  materials.  This  Statement is effective  for inventory
     costs  incurred  during  fiscal years  beginning  after June 15, 2005.  The
     initial  application  of SFAS No. 151 will have no impact on the  Company's
     financial statements.

     In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 152, "Accounting for Real Estate
     Time-Sharing Transactions - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67."
     This Statement  references the financial  accounting and reporting guidance
     for  real  estate  time-sharing  transactions  that is  provided  in  AICPA
     Statement  of  Position  04-2,  "Accounting  for Real  Estate  Time-Sharing
     Transactions."  This Statement also states that the guidance for incidental
     operations and costs  incurred to sell real estate  projects does not apply
     to real estate time-sharing  transactions.  This Statement is effective for
     financial  statements for fiscal years  beginning  after June 15, 2005. The
     initial  application  of SFAS No. 152 will have no impact on the  Company's
     financial statements.

     In December 2004,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,  "Exchanges of Nonmonetary
     Assets - - an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29." This  Statement  eliminates
     the exception for nonmonetary  exchanges of similar  productive  assets and
     replaces it with a general  exception for exchanges of  nonmonetary  assets
     that  do  not  have  commercial  substance.   A  nonmonetary  exchange  has
     commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to
     change  significantly  as a  result  of the  exchange.  This  Statement  is
     effective  for  nonmonetary  asset  exchanges  occurring in fiscal  periods
     beginning  after June 15, 2005. The Company does not expect  application of
     SFAS No. 153 to have a material affect on its financial statements.

     In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
     of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 123 (revised  2004),  "Share-Based
     Payment"  (SFAS 123R),  which  replaces SFAS 123 and supercedes APB Opinion
     No. 25. SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including
     grants  of  employee  stock  options,  to be  recognized  in the  financial
     statements based on their fair values. The proforma disclosures  previously
     permitted  under SFAS 123 no longer  will be an  alternative  to  financial
     statement recognition.  For the Company, SFAS 123R is effective for periods
     beginning  after  December  15,  2005.  Early  application  of SFAS 123R is
     encouraged, but not required. We plan to adopt SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006
     using  the  modified  prospective   application  method  described  in  the
     statement. Under the modified prospective application method, we will apply
     the  standard  to new  awards,  and to  awards  modified,  repurchased,  or
     cancelled  after the required  effective date.  Additionally,  compensation
     cost for the  unvested  portion of awards  outstanding  as of the  required
     effective date will be recognized as compensation  expense as the requisite
     service is rendered after the required effective date.

     We are  evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 123R and expect that we will
     not record substantial non-cash stock compensation  expenses.  The adoption
     of SFAS 123R is not expected to have a significant  effect on our financial
     condition,  results of operations, and cash flows. The future impact of the
     adoption  of SFAS 123R  cannot be  predicted  at this time  because it will
     depend on levels of share-based payments granted by us in the future.

2.   INCOME TAXES

     The Company had no current State or Federal  income tax expense for each of
     the years ended April 30, 2005 and 2004.

     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined  based on the difference
     between currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax expense or benefit is the
     result of the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

     Deferred  income taxes arise  principally  from the  temporary  differences
     between  financial  statement and income tax  recognition  of allowance for
     doubtful  accounts,   note  receivable   allowance,   investment  valuation
     adjustments, inventory reserve and from net operating losses.

     The  components  of deferred  taxes at April 30,  2005 in the  accompanying
     balance sheet is summarized below:

     Note receivable allowance                                     680,000
     Capital loss carryforward                                      32,000
     Net operating loss carryforward                            11,900,000
       Less valuation allowance                                (12,900,000)
                                                               -----------
       Deferred tax asset-net                                  $         -

     At April 30,  2005,  the Company has  approximately  $26,000,000  of unused
     Federal net operating  loss  carryforwards,  which expire in the years 2005
     through 2025.

     Approximately  $640,000 of the net  operating  loss  carryforwards  for tax
     purposes are limited due to statutory  changes in the tax law in connection
     with the change in more than 50% ownership of the Company in 1988.  Because
     of statutory  requirements  in the law,  that portion of the net  operating
     loss carryforward applicable to the period prior to the ownership change is
     limited to use of approximately  $35,800 per year until it expires.  As the
     net operating losses expire,  at a minimum,  approximately  $461,000 of the
     tax net operating loss carryforward will not be available for the Company's
     future use.

3.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     Series E preferred  shares were  entitled to receive a cumulative  dividend
     equivalent  to $1,600  per  month,  of which  none have  been  declared  or
     accrued.

     Series H preferred  shares ("Series H") were entitled to receive a dividend

     have been declared or accrued.

     Series  L  preferred  shares  ("Series  L")  were  entitled  to  receive  a
     cumulative  dividend of 7%,  payable in common  shares of the Company.  The
     Series L are convertible to common shares at twenty percent off the closing
     price of the common shares.  All shares were  automatically  converted into
     common shares two years after issuance.  No dividends have been declared or
     accrued.

     Any split or combination of common shares required a simultaneous  split or
     combination  of each  series  of  preferred  shares  and visa  versa.  Upon
     liquidation  or  dissolution  of the  Company,  holders  of each  series of
     preferred  shares  were  entitled  to  receive,  to the extent of their par
     value,  pro rata with other  preferred  shareholders  and before holders of
     common  shares,   all  assets  legally   available  for   distribution   to
     stockholders.  Each series of  preferred  shares  outstanding  as of fiscal
     year-end is nonvoting.

4.   CONTINGENCIES

     Litigation

     The Company is liable for Texas state franchise taxes and accrued  interest
     of approximately $99,000.

     Also,  the Company has been  advised that a Notice of Filing of Petition to
     Register  Foreign  Judgment  is being made to  domesticate  in the State of
     Texas a judgment obtained regarding The Audio Visual Group dba AIMS Media v
     Goldstar   Entertainment   Video  Corporation.   Should  such  petition  be
     successful, the Company may become liable in the amount of $550,000.

     Going Concern

     The accompanying  financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
     company will  continue as a going  concern.  The company has had  recurring
     operating losses for the past several years and is dependent upon financing
     to  continue  operations.  The  financial  statements  do not  include  any
     adjustments that might result from the outcome of this  uncertainty.  It is
     management's plan to find an operating company to merge with, thus creating
     necessary operating revenue.

Item 8.    Disagreements on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
           ----------------------------------------------------

During the past three years, there were no disagreements between the Company and
the  auditors  regarding  any  matter of  accounting  principles  or  practices,
financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure.

Change in Independent Accountants

     On  May  13,  2005,   Registrant   dismissed   Larry  O'Donnell  CPA,  P.C.
("O'Donnell")  as its  principal  accountant.  Such  action had been  previously
approved by the  Registrant's  Board of  Directors.  O'Donnell's  reports on the
financial  statements  of the Company for the two most recent fiscal years ended
April 30,2004 and April 30,2003 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer
of opinion,  and were not modified as to audit scope or  accounting  principles.
O'Donnell had been appointed as auditor of the corporation on May 12,1998.  From
the time of O'Donnell's appointment as the Company's auditor through the date of
this report,  there have been no  disagreements  with O'Donnell on any matter of
accounting  principles or practices,  financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure, which disagreements,  if not resolved to the satisfaction of
O'Donnell,  would have caused  O'Donnell to make reference to the subject matter
of the  disagreements in connection with its report.  During the two most recent
fiscal years and through the date of this report  there have been no  reportable
events.

     On May 13, 2005, the Registrant  retained  Comiskey & Company,  P.C. as the
Company's  independent  accountants  to  conduct  an audit  of the  Registrant's
financial  statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005.  This action was
previously approved by the Registrant's Board of Directors.


Item 8A.    Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report,  our Chief  Executive
Officer  and Chief  Financial  Officer  (the  "Certifying  Officers")  conducted
evaluations of our disclosure controls and procedures. As defined under Sections
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 Act, as amended
(the  "Exchange  Act")  the term  "disclosure  controls  and  procedures"  means
controls  and other  procedures  of an issuer  that are  designed to ensure that
information  required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files
or  submits  under the  Exchange  Act is  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and
reported,  within  the time  periods  specified  in the SEC's  rules and  forms.
Disclosure  controls and procedures include,  without  limitation,  controls and
procedures  designed to ensure that  information  required to be disclosed by an
issuer  in the  reports  that it files or  submits  under  the  Exchange  Act is
accumulated  and  communicated  to  the  issuer's   management,   including  the
Certifying  Officers,  to allow timely decisions regarding required  disclosure.
Based on this evaluation,  the Certifying Officers originally concluded that our
disclosure  controls  and  procedures  were  effective  to ensure that  material
information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by our management on
a timely  basis in order to comply  with our  disclosure  obligations  under the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

Item 12.   Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
           ----------------------------------------------

On February 24, 1999 in order to provide cash and future stream of cash flow the
Company sold to Texas Country Gold Development,  Inc., a company affiliated with
its President, 700,000 shares of Wincroft for $87,500 payable $1,000 in cash and
in a note yielding 6%.

On May 20, 1997 Adina,  Inc. a company  affiliated with Mr Wettreich  subscribed
for  (post  reverse)  1,345,295  restricted  Preferred  Shares,  Series J of the
Company with payment by the transfer of 6,029,921  restricted  common  shares of
Alexander Mark Investments (USA), Inc. to the Company.  892,215 of the Preferred
Shares were issued upon execution of the Agreement and 453,080 were subsequently
issued as deferred  consideration.  The Preferred Shares have one vote per share
and vote with the  common  shares,  are non  convertible,  non-yielding  and are
subordinate to outstanding  preferred  shares but have a liquidation  preference
over common shares. On April 18, 1998 Adina sold the Preferred Shares,  Series J
to Forsam Venture Funding,  Inc., a company of which Mr. Wettreich is a director
and officer.

Stock Transfer Company of America,  Inc., ("STCA") a company affiliated with the
President of the Company provided services during the year ended April 1999, and
1998 as a securities transfer agent. A total of $1,000, and $18,855 were paid by
Company for these services. In the opinion of the Board of Directors,  the terms
of these  transactions  were as fair to the company as could have been made with
an unaffiliated party. Additionally,  STCA received management services from the
Company  and paid $6,000 per month  starting  in  November  1997 until April 30,
1998.

Until March 1998 the Company  leased  10,000  square feet of offices  from Forme
Capital,  Inc., a company  affiliated  with the President of the Company.  Total
rent paid during  fiscal 1998 and 1997 was $135,383  and $80,000,  respectively.
The lease agreement and transactions  related thereto were approved by a vote of
Company's  shareholders.  In September  1997 the lease was  terminated by mutual
consent and the  Company  paid  approximately  $17,000 on a month to month basis
thereafter.  In February, 1998 the Company vacated the premises and consolidated
its offices at 2415 Midway Road. The Company surrendered the Midway lease to the
landlord in July 1998 for $39,781.

During  fiscal 1998 and 1997,  Company  received  dividend  payments  from Forme
Capital,  Inc.,  Preferred Shares Series C in the amount of $46,657 for 1998 and
$46,657 for 1997.

On January 17, 1996, the Company's  disinterested  directors  approved a secured
loan to the Corporate  Secretary in the amount of $75,156 to exercise options to
purchase  Company stock.  This loan bears  interest at a rate 6% per annum.  The
Company agreed to accept Company stock in settlement of the loan.

On August 1, 1996, the Company's disinterested directors approved a secured loan
to the Corporate Secretary in the amount of $14,000. This loan bears interest at
a rate of 6% per annum and was repaid as of January 31, 1997.

On  September  25, 1996 the  Company's  disinterested  directors  approved a non
recourse  secured  loan  to the  President  of the  Company  in  the  amount  of
$1,800,000.  This loan  bears  interest  at a rate of 6% per  annum.  During the
quarter  ended  January 31, 2002 the Company  extinguished  as paid in full this
non-recourse  loan by the transfer to the Company as treasury stock of 1,345,295
Preferred Stock Series J of the Company, such preferred shares being transferred
to the Registrant as substitution for and in lieu of the original  collateral of
a Pledge  Agreement  securing such  non-recourse  loan which was secured only on
36,250  post-reverse  split common shares of the Registrant,  and which had been
subsequently written off by the Company as uncollectable.

On March 4, 1997,  the  Company  acquired  the US and  Canadian  rights to PCAMS
software  a  payphone  contract  and  management  system  software  from  Meteor
Technology,  plc payable by the cancellation of  (pound)2,000,000  of loan stock
owed to the Company by Meteor and  (pound)500,000 by the issuance by the Company
to Meteor of 80,960 restricted  common shares.  Mr. Wettreich and Ms. Fitzgerald
who were  directors  of both  companies at the time did not  participate  in any
directors  votes in  relation  to this  transaction.  On May 11,  1998 the PCAMS
software was sold back to Meteor for  (pound)70,000  as the Company did not have
sufficient  funds to market the  software and was  restricted  in its ability to
sublicense the software.

On May 20, 1997, the Company's  subsidiary Third Planet amended the terms of its
existing  distribution  agreement with DigiPhone  International  a subsidiary of
Meteor  Technology  plc, to market  exclusively  all TPP products on a worldwide
basis. Mr. Wettreich and Ms. Fitzgerald who were directors of these companies at
the  time  did not  participate  in any  directors  votes  in  relation  to this
transaction.

In  May,  1997,  the  Company  accepted  a  Preferred  Share,   Series  J  stock
subscription  by Adina,  Inc.,  a public  company of which Mr.  Wettreich  was a
director and officer. Mr. Wettreich did not participate in any directors vote in
respect to this transaction. The consideration for the issuance of the Preferred
Shares was the transfer of eighty (80%)  percent of Alexander  Mark  Investments
(USA),  Inc. a public company whose major asset was fifty-seven (57%) percent of
the outstanding  ordinary shares of Meteor. The Preferred Shares,  Series J have
one vote per share voting with the common shares, have a liquidation  preference
over the common shares but are subordinate to the outstanding  Preferred Shares,
are not convertible and pay no dividends.  They also are subject to a forward or
reverse  split in any  instances  for which the common  shares are  subject to a
forward or reverse split on the exact same basis.

On  May  30,  1997,  the  Company  subscribed  for(pound)500,000  1997-2007  10%
unsecured  redeemable loan stock of Meteor by paying cash. Mr. Wettreich and Ms.
Fitzgerald who were directors of both companies at the time, did not participate
in any directors votes in relation to this transaction.

On March 20, 1998  Registrant  sold to Forsam Venture  Funding,  Inc.  3,837,706
shares in Alexander Mark investments  (USA),Inc for its then net asset value per
share of $24,233 payable by the issuance by Forsam of 8% Preferred  Shares.  Mr.
Wettreich is a director of Forsam and did not  participate  in any director vote
relating  to this  transaction.  At the  same  time  Registrant  sold  to  Abuja
Consultancy, Ltd. 2,192,265 shares in Alexander Mark Investments (USA), Inc. for
$13,830 cash. These transactions  represented  Registrants total shareholding in
Alexander Mark Investments (USA),Inc.

On March 20, 1998 Registrant sold to Abuja Consultancy, Ltd. 1,149,464 shares in
Meteor Technology plc representing its total  shareholding in that company for a
price  calculated  at the then pro rata net asset value of Meteor  amounting  to
$16,187 cash.

On March 23, 1998,  Registrant  acquired from Alexander Mark Investments  (USA),
Inc.  43,000  Preferred  Shares,  Series B of Forsam Venture Funding for $43,000
cash.

On February 23, 2003 the Board of Registrant  determined that in order to pursue
a merger  transaction  it was in  Registrant's  interest  to present a corporate
structure  and financial  statement  structure  that would be most  conducive to
effecting such a merger transaction,  and that as Registrant was still the owner
of 700,000 shares in Wincroft,  Inc, a company  affiliated with the President of
Registrant,  which shares have been  written  down to nil value in  Registrant's
books for several years,  Registrant  transfered for nil  consideration  all the
shares of Wincroft,Inc owned by Registrant to Wincroft, Inc as Treasury shares.

The Company has no  compensatory  plans or  arrangements  whereby any  executive
officer  would  receive  payments  from the  Company  or a third  party upon his
resignation,  retirement  or  termination  of  employment,  or from a change  in
control of the Company or a change in the officer's responsibilities following a
change in control.  Under the 1996 Stock Option Plan or under the Company's 1991
Outside  Directors  Stock Option Plan options  granted under these plans contain
provisions pursuant to which the unvested portions of outstanding options become

EXHIBIT 31.1      SECTION 302 CERTIFICATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER


I, Danny Wettreich, certify that:

     1.   I  have  reviewed  this  annual  report  on  Form  10-KSB  of  Camelot
          Corporation;

     2.   Based on my knowledge,  this annual report does not contain any untrue
          statement  of a  material  fact  or  omit to  state  a  material  fact
          necessary to make the statements  made, in light of the  circumstances
          under which such  statements were made, not misleading with respect to
          the period covered by this annual report;

     3.   Based on my knowledge,  the financial statements,  and other financial
          information  included in this  annual  report,  fairly  present in all
          material respects the financial  condition,  results of operations and
          cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods  presented in
          this annual report;

     4.   The registrant's  other certifying  officers and I are responsible for
          establishing  and maintaining  disclosure  controls and procedures (as
          defined in Exchange Act Rules  13a-15(e) and  15d-15(e))  and internal
          control  over  financial  reporting  (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
          13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have;

               a.   Designed such disclosure controls and procedures,  or caused
                    such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                    our  supervision,   to  ensure  that  material   information
                    relating  to  the  registrant,  including  its  consolidated
                    subsidiaries,  is made  known to us by others  within  those
                    entities,  particularly  during  the  period  in which  this
                    report is being prepared;
               b.   Designed such internal control over financial reporting,  or
                    caused such internal control over financial  reporting to be
                    designed  under  our  supervision,   to  provide  reasonable
                    assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting
                    and the  preparation  of financial  statements  for external
                    purposes in accordance  with generally  accepted  accounting
                    principles;
               c.   Evaluated the  effectiveness of the registrant's  disclosure
                    controls  and  procedures  and  presented in this report our
                    conclusions  about the  effectiveness  of the  controls  and
                    procedures,  as of the  end of the  period  covered  by this
                    report based on such evaluation; and
               d.   Disclosed  in this  report  any  change in the  registrant's
                    internal  control over  financial  reporting  that  occurred
                    during the  registrant's  most recent  fiscal  quarter  (the
                    registrant's  fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual
                    report)  that  has  materially  affected,  or is  reasonable
                    likely  to  materially  affect,  the  registrant's  internal
                    control over financial reporting; and

     5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based
          on our most recent  evaluation  of  internal  control  over  financial
          reporting,  to the  registrant's  auditors and the audit  committee of
          registrant's  board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
          function):

               a.   All significant  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                    design or  operation  of  internal  control  over  financial
                    reporting  are  reasonably  likely to  adversely  affect the
                    registrant's  ability  to  record,  process,  summarize  and
                    report financial information; and
               b.   Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                    or  other  employees  who  have a  significant  role  in the
                    registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
