                                     PART I

Item 1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Church Loans & Investments Trust ("the Trust") is a real estate investment trust
organized under the laws of the State of Texas in March 1963. Although the Trust
has the  authority to engage in the  business of buying,  selling and leasing of
real  estate,  the Trust  has  heretofore  restricted  its  business  activities
primarily  to making  loans to churches and other  nonprofit  organizations  and
assisted  living  centers  which are secured by a first  mortgage on real estate
owned by such borrowers.

The period of duration of the Trust, unless dissolved in accordance with law, or
by the consent of the owners of shares of beneficial  interest in the Trust,  is
perpetual.  The Trust may be dissolved by the affirmative  vote of not less than
two-thirds of the owners of outstanding  shares of the Trust.  Owners of Secured
Savings  Certificates,  a debt instrument  issued by the Trust,  have no vote in
regard to any activities of the Trust, including dissolution.

The control and management of the Trust properties,  and all powers necessary or
appropriate  to  effect  any and all of the  purposes  for  which  the  Trust is
organized, is vested in the Board of Trust Managers.

The  number of shares of  beneficial  interest  in the Trust  which the Trust is
authorized to issue is unlimited.

The Trust is  qualified  as a "real  estate  investment  trust"  under  Sections
856-858 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the "Internal  Revenue
Code" or "Code").  It is the  intention of the Trust to continue to qualify as a
real estate investment trust under the Code.

The Trust  maintains  an office  located at 5305 I-40 West,  Amarillo,  TX 79106
(telephone 806/358-3666).

As mentioned  above,  the Trust is  primarily  engaged in the business of making
mortgage loans to churches and other nonprofit organizations and assisted living
centers.  The  Declaration  of Trust  restricts the  investments of the Trust to
loans  secured by a first  mortgage,  deed of trust or other lien  covering real
property with the amount of such loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of the value of the
real  property  securing  such loan as  determined  by a  competent  independent
appraiser.  Although  the Trust has been  primarily  in the  business  of making
long-term  mortgage  loans,  during  the past  several  years  it has also  been

                                       -4-
<PAGE>

actively involved in making short-term  interim or construction loans to finance
the  construction  of church  buildings,  the  construction  of assisted  living
centers,   the  purchase  of  real  estate,   or  the  refinancing  of  existing
indebtedness.  Most of the interim loans  presently  being made by the Trust are
associated with bond offerings of churches and other nonprofit organizations and
assisted living centers. These interim loans are scheduled to be repaid from the
proceeds of the bond offerings.

The Trust is not limited to the location of the  property  securing any loans in
which it may invest and seeks to spread its  investments  in areas of the United
States where favorable yields prevail.

As of March 31, 1999, the Trust has 121 permanent and interim mortgage loans and
investments in church bonds having a principal balance of $37,657,511,  with the
average principal amount thereof being $311,219.10.  The interest rates on these
loans vary from 7.5% to 17% per annum with the weighted average interest rate of
mortgage  loans and church bonds being  10.06% per annum at March 31, 1999.  The
original  terms of these  loans  vary  from one year to thirty  years,  with the
majority being for a term of twenty years.

During the fiscal year of the Trust ending March 31, 1999, the net income of the
Trust was  $2,505,826,  as compared to $2,226,533 in fiscal 1998, an increase of
12.54%.  The  increase  in net income of the Trust was due to  several  factors,
including (a)an increase in the investment in mortgage and interim loans made by
the  Trust  thereby  increasing  the net  interest  income  of the trust and the
commitment fees earned by the Trust; and (b) an increase in income realized from
loan purchase discounts.

The net income of the Trust for each of the quarters  during  fiscal 1999 was as
follows:    first    quarter-$608,529;     second    quarter-$672,504;     third
quarter-$597,839; and fourth quarter-$626,954.

The operational  expense of the Trust decreased from $698,138 during fiscal 1998
to  $684,706  in  fiscal  1999.  The  operational  expenses  of the  Trust  were
approximately  15.01% of its gross  income for the year ended  March 31, 1999 as
compared to 17.50% for the year ended March 31, 1998. The operational expense of
the Trust  included  general and  administrative  expenses and  compensation  to
members of the Board of Trust Managers.

During  fiscal 1999,  the Trust  advanced  loan  proceeds of  $35,518,740  on 32
different  loans.  Most,  if not all, of such loans bear  interest at a variable
rate  varying  from 1.5% to 2% per annum in excess of the prime rate of interest
published  by the Wall  Street  Journal  and known as the "Wall  Street  Journal
Prime."

During the first 10 months of fiscal 1999,  the Trust employed a total of 4 full
time employees and employed,  as needed, one additional  part-time employee.  On
February 1, 1999, the Trust added one full-time employee.

                                       -5-
<PAGE>
The business  conditions in which the Trust operates has become more competitive
in the past fiscal year as more and more banks are  re-entering  the business of
making loans to churches,  especially  the more  desirable,  less risky,  church
loans.  If this trend  continues,  the rates and fees which the trust can charge
may decrease.  However,  loan demand  remains good as evidenced by the number of
loan  requests  received  by the  Trust  and  the  number  of  loan  commitments
outstanding as of March 31, 1999.

Item 2: DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY

The Trust  maintains as its only place of business  its offices  located at 5305
I-40  West,  in  Amarillo,  Texas.  Such  building  is owned by the Trust and is
occupied  solely by the  Trust.  There is no debt owed by Trust in regard to its
real property.

The real properties of the Trust,  net of depreciation and excluding real estate
acquired  through  foreclosure,  are not a  significant  portion of the  Trust's
assets, representing less than 1% of the Trust's total assets.

As previously mentioned,  the Trust's primary business is the making of mortgage
loans to churches and other nonprofit organizations and assisted living centers.
The Declaration of Trust restricts the investments of the Trust to loans secured
by a first  mortgage,  deed of trust,  or other lien covering real property with
the amount of such loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of the value of the real property
securing  such loan.  The  Declaration  of Trust may not be amended  without the
affirmative  vote of  two-thirds  (2/3 rds) of the  Certificates  of  Beneficial
Interest  entitled to vote.  The Board of Trust  Managers'  general policy is to
limit  investment  of Trust  assets  in any one  mortgage  loan to not more than
$2,000,000.  All such investment in mortgage loans is for the purpose of earning
income for the Trust.

Due to several  foreclosures of nonperforming loans, the Trust holds title or an
interest  in the title to two  properties  which are  presently  for sale by the
Trust. These properties are located in San Antonio, Texas and Decatur, Georgia.

Item 5: MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

(a) Market Information

Item 6: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION

Results of Operations--1999 compared to 1998

During the fiscal year ended  March 31,  1999,  interest  income and fees of the
Trust  increased  by $572,504  (14.35%)  over the  previous  fiscal  year.  Such
increase  was  primarily  attributable  to  several  factors,  including  (a) an
increase in the amount of  performing  loans made by the Trust  during the year;
and (b) the  realization  of income from the early payoff of loans  purchased by
the  Trust at a  discount.  Although,  there  was a  decrease  in the  amount of
performing interim loans held by the Trust from $10,732,915 as of March 31, 1998
to  $10,406,937  as of March 31,  1999,  there  was an  increase  in  performing
mortgage  loans during the recent fiscal year from  $22,165,629  as of March 31,
1998 to  $23,109,175  as of March 31,  1999.  Therefore,  the  total  performing
mortgage loans,  church bonds and performing interim  construction loans held by
the Trust  increased from  $32,898,544 as of March 31, 1998 to $33,516,112 as of
March 31, 1999. More  significantly,  there was an increase in the investment in
mortgage and interim loans made by the Trust during  fiscal 1998 of  $33,238,225
as compared to $35,518,740  during fiscal 1999.  This  represents an increase of
$2,280,515  or 6.86%.  The increase in the  investment  by the Trust in mortgage
loans also  contributed  to an increase of $58,860 in commitment  fees earned by
the Trust in fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal 1998. Income from the realization
of loan  discounts from loan purchases also increased from $236,512 for the year
ended March 31, 1998 to $330,074 for the year ended March 31, 1999,  an increase
of $93,562.

These  increases  more that offset a decrease in the  average  interest  rate on
loans and church  bonds held by the Trust  from  10.95% as of March 31,  1998 to
10.06% as of March 31, 1999 and a decrease in interest on temporary  investments
held by the Trust from  $62,705 as of March 31,  1998 to $34,996 as of March 31,
1999.

In fiscal  1999,  the average  aggregate  amount of total debt  outstanding  was
$3,030,868 more than in fiscal 1998.  Accordingly,  the interest  expense of the
Trust  increased  by  $218,088 as compared to fiscal  1998.  Such  increase  was
primarily  due to an  increase  in the  debt of the  Trust.  Such  increase  was
somewhat  offset by a decrease in the  Trust's  cost of funds.  The  approximate
weighted  average  annual  interest  rate upon the  aggregate  outstanding  debt
decreased from 7.44% during fiscal 1998 to 6.90% during fiscal 1999.

The net income of the Trust for fiscal 1999 was $2,505,826 ($.36 per share),  an
increase of $279,293  (12.54%) from the previous  fiscal year. Such increase was
primarily  attributable  to an increase in net interest income in fiscal 1999 as
compared to fiscal 1998 as  discussed  above.  Dividends  related to fiscal 1999
were  $2,450,283 or $.35 per share.  Dividends are based on taxable income which
varies from net income reported in the financial statements because of

                                       -8-
<PAGE>
temporary  differences  (differences  between  the  tax  basis  of an  asset  or
liability and its reported  amount in the financial  statements that will result
in taxable or deductible amounts in future years).  Future dividends may be more
or less  than  net  income  reported  in the  financial  statements  because  of
variances in these temporary differences.

During  fiscal 1999,  the prime  interest  rate  decreased  from 8.50% to 7.75%.
Should the prime interest rate decrease during fiscal 2000, the interest expense
of the Trust  will  generally  decrease  and the net income of the Trust will in
turn generally  increase.  Should the prime interest rate increase during fiscal
2000,  the  interest  expense of the Trust will  generally  increase and the net
income of the Trust will in turn generally decrease.

Payments  received on the interim and  permanent  loan  portfolio and the church
bonds  held by the  Trust  increased  from  $31,194,006  during  fiscal  1998 to
$35,610,274  during  fiscal  1999,  an increase  of 14.16%.  This  increase  was
attributable  to: (a) an increase in interim  loans made by the Trust during the
year ended  March 31,  1999 and (b) the  pay-off  prior to  maturity  of several
mortgage loans.

During fiscal 1998, the Trust foreclosed on three nonperforming loans with total
principal   balances  of   approximately   $1,360,000.   One  loan   constituted
approximately $976,000 of the total and was secured by an assisted living center
located in Sedona,  Arizona. The Trust sold its interest in this property during
fiscal 1999. However,  the Trust financed such purchase by the acceptance of the
purchaser's  interim promissory note payable to the Trust.  Therefore,  the gain
from this sale will be recognized by the Trust as such interim note is paid. The
Trust sold another  property located in Colorado  Springs,  Colorado in exchange
for part cash and the remainder of the purchase price is paid pursuant to a note
executed by the purchaser of such property. Once again, the Trust will recognize
the  balance  of the gain  from the sale of this  property  as the note is paid.
Finally, the Trust has also sold a portion of a piece of property located in San
Antonio,  Texas which it had received in a foreclosure conducted in fiscal 1998.
Presently, the Trust is actively seeking disposition of the balance of this land
located in San Antonio, Texas which is unimproved raw land.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Trust is engaged  primarily in the business of making  permanent and interim
loans to churches and other  non-profit  organizations,  and to other borrowers,
including  businesses  engaged in the building and operation of assisted  living
centers. At March 31, 1999, the Trust had eight loans to two different borrowers
which are  secured  by  assisted  living  centers  which  totaled  approximately
$12,233,000.   Four  of  these  loans  were  to  affiliated  borrowers  totaling
approximately  $9,001,000 and with the remaining four loans to another  borrower
totaling  $3,232,000.   In  addition,   the  Trust  had  four  loan  commitments
outstanding as of March 31, 1999 for the  construction and financing of assisted
living centers in the total approximate amount of $3,825,000.

                                       -9-

The assets of the Trust  primarily  consist of its loan portfolio and its office
building and facilities.  The  operational  expense of the Trust is comprised of
the  maintenance  of its office  building,  the  payment of the  salaries of its
management and clerical staff and the payment for legal and accounting services.
Substantially  all of the Trust assets are invested in the permanent and interim
loans made by the Trust. The only potential  liquidity problems of the Trust are
related to the timely and proper  repayment by the Trust of the leveraged  funds
it has  borrowed  to make loans in excess of its capital and the ability to fund
loan  commitments  which  totaled  $11,452,000  at March  31,  1999.  All of the
indebtedness  of  the  Trust  is  generally  classified  as  short  term  having
maturities ranging from "on demand" to maturities repayable over various periods
extending through 2001.

The annual  maturities upon all debt obligations of the Trust  outstanding as of
March  31,  1999 for the next  two  fiscal  years  are:  2000--$14,145,040;  and
2001-$726,000. These debt obligations primarily consist of the Trust's bank line
of  credit,   Master   Note   Agreements   and  Secured   Savings   Certificates
("Certificates")  which have been previously  issued by the Trust.  Certificates
outstanding  as of March 31,  1999 that will  mature  during the next two fiscal
years are: 2000-$2,037,376; and 2001-$726,000.

At March 31, 1999 loans to the Trust under Master Note  Agreements  which are in
effect demand notes total  $8,257,664.  In the past,  the Trust has utilized its
bank line of  credit,  principal  paid to the Trust  upon its  outstanding  loan
portfolio,  and the proceeds  received from the sale of Certificates in order to
meet its maturing obligations.

At March 31,  1999,  the  balance  which could be borrowed by the Trust upon its
bank line of credit was  $11,150,000.  The  principal  payments  scheduled to be
received by the Trust upon its loan  portfolio  for the years  ending  March 31,
2000 and 2001 are  $13,376,084,  and $1,616,852,  respectively.  Assuming all of
these scheduled principal payments are received,  these payments,  together with
the balance  available to Church  Loans on its bank line of credit,  would allow
Church Loans to have sufficient funds to meet its maturing  obligations and fund
loan  commitments  without the  necessity  for Church  Loans  having to sell any
additional Certificates or borrow funds from other sources.

During fiscal 1998 and 1997 the Trust sold Certificates in the principal amounts
of $3,314,121 and $2,648,579,  respectively. Due to the cost of registration and
the  other  costs of sales of such  Certificates,  the cost of these  funds  are
normally  higher than the cost of borrowing  from bank sources or master  notes.
Therefore,  the Trust  discontinued  the registration of Certificates and ceased
the sales of  Certificates  as of July 16,  1997.  The Trust  also  obtained  an
increase in its bank line of credit from  $10,000,000 to  $15,000,000  effective
September 1, 1997.  Based upon the success of the Trust to obtain  borrowings in
the past, the Trust is confident that,  should it be necessary,  it will be able
to register and sell  Certificates  or obtain  additional  bank financing in the
future  in  sufficient  amounts  for  the  Trust  to  timely  meet  all  of  its
obligations.

                                      -10-
<PAGE>
Should all the scheduled  principal payments upon loans made by the Trust not be
received,  and should the Trust be unable to borrow  against its line of credit,
and should  borrowings from other sources not be available it would be necessary
for the Trust to sell a portion of its mortgage  loan  portfolio in order for it
to meet all of its  financial  obligations.  At March 31,  1999,  the  principal
balance of the loan and church bond portfolio of the Trust was $37,071,141.  The
weighted  average  interest rate on loans and church bonds was 10.06% per annum.
In view of the normal  marketability  of  conventional  loans,  the Trust  would
probably be required to discount the great  majority of these loans in order for
them to be  attractive  for  purchase.  The  principal  amount of these loans if
discounted to yield a weighted  average  interest rate of 12%, 14% and 16% would
be  $31,077,973,  $26,638,263,  and  $23,308,480,   respectively.  There  is  no
assurance  that the  Trust  would be able to sell  all,  or a  portion  of,  its
portfolio  of loans,  in which  event,  it would be  necessary  for the Trust to
secure a loan,  or  loans,  from a lender  in  order  for the  Trust to meet its
financial  obligations.  There is no  assurance  that the Trust would be able to
secure a loan in such instance.  The Trust has sold only one of the loans in its
mortgage loan portfolio and therefore has limited experience in this area.

Principal payments scheduled to be received by the Trust upon its permanent loan
portfolio  during the years ending March 31, 2000 and 2001,  if not used to fund
new loan  commitments,  would be used to reduce the outstanding  indebtedness of
the  Trust.  Should  the Trust use the  payments  of  principal  which  shall be
received upon its loan  portfolio to reduce its  outstanding  indebtedness,  the
interest  expense of the Trust will  decrease.  In such  instance,  whether  the
decrease in the interest  income will exceed,  or be less than,  the decrease in
the interest  expense will largely be dependent  upon the prime rate of interest
prevailing  at such time due to the fact that the  interest  to be earned by the
Trust upon its mortgage loan  portfolio is generally  based upon a fixed rate of
interest or a variable rate of interest that  periodically  reprices,  while the
interest  to be paid by the Trust upon its  outstanding  debts is  directly,  or
indirectly, tied to the prime rate of interest charged by major domestic banks.

As of March 31, 1999, a substantial  portion of the promissory  notes evidencing
the  loans  made by the Trust  have  been  pledged  to  secure  its  outstanding
indebtedness.  At March 31, 1999  promissory  notes in the  principal  amount of
$5,406,722  had been pledged to secure  Certificates  which had been  previously
sold by the Trust. The required  collateral for these Certificates (based on the
ratio of 1 to 1 for Certificates in Series O) was $2,763,376,  leaving an excess
of  promissory  notes  which  have been  pledged  by the  Trust to  secure  said
Certificates of $2,643,346.  Additionally,  promissory notes totaling $9,304,931
were  pledged  against  the bank  line of credit  which had a total  outstanding
balance  of  $3,850,000.   The  required  collateral  for  this  bank  loan  was
$4,235,000,  leaving an excess of  promissory  notes which have been  pledged to
secure  said bank notes of  $5,069,931.  These  excess  promissory  notes may be
reassigned by the Indenture Trustee or bank to the Trust to be sold in order for
the Trust to meet its financial obligations. Should it be necessary in order for
the Trust to meet its  financial  obligations,  these excess notes  amounting to
$7,713,277 and other additional  promissory  notes in the approximate  amount of
$22,359,488 (for a total amount of $30,072,765) would be available to be sold by
the Trust to meet its financial obligations.  Should the excess promissory notes
be  assigned  by the  Indenture  Trustee  or bank  to

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
the Trust as heretofore  described,  all  outstanding  Certificates  sold by the
Trust and the bank line of credit  would  continue to be secured by the required
ratio of notes pledged to the principal  balance of these  Certificates  and the
bank line of credit.  There is no assurance that the Trust would be able to sell
all, or any portion of these notes.

Cash flows from  operating  activities  consists  primarily  of net income.  The
primary  components  of net income are  interest  income and  expense.  Interest
income  should  continue  to be the main source of cash  provided  by  operating
activities;  however,  the  availability of this cash flow is dependent upon the
ability of the borrowers to repay loans.  Although  there was an increase in the
amount of non-performing  loans as of March 31, 1999 compared to March 31, 1998,
management  does not  expect  material  changes  in such loans in the near term.
Accordingly,  cash provided by operating  activities has been and is expected to
be a relatively stable source of cash flow.

Cash flows from investing  activities  results  primarily from investment in and
payments received on mortgage and interim construction loans and church bonds.

Cash flows  from  financing  activities  relate  primarily  to the  payments  on
Certificates  and  borrowings  and  payments  on notes  payable  and the line of
credit.  Borrowings  are made as funds are  needed to make  loans or as  current
obligations become due. Based upon the success of the Trust to obtain borrowings
in the past, the Trust is confident that it will be able to obtain borrowings in
the future in sufficient  amounts,  along with payments to be received on loans,
to timely meet its obligations.  Furthermore,  the Trust is confident that if it
decides to register additional  Certificates in the future it would have similar
success in selling the Certificates as it has had in the past.

Inflation

At March 31, 1999, the weighted  average  interest rate on the mortgage loan and
church  bond  portfolio  of the Trust was  10.06% per annum  while the  weighted
average  interest  rate upon all  borrowings  of the Trust was 6.90% per  annum.
Although a majority of the loans  constituting  the loan  portfolio of the Trust
have been made at  variable  rates of interest  that  generally  reprice  either
daily, annually, or otherwise periodically,  a portion of the loans constituting
the  Trust's  loan  portfolio  have been  made at fixed  rates of  interest  and
therefore are not subject to being increased or decreased during the term of the
loan.  All  of  the   indebtedness  of  the  Trust,   other  than  the  existing
Certificates,  is  either  directly  or  indirectly  tied to the  prime  rate of
interest  charged by major  banking  institutions  and  therefore  is subject to
fluctuation.  During periods of inflation, the prime rate of interest charged by
major  banking  institutions,  as well as the interest rate or cost of borrowing
money from any lender, generally increases. Consequently, during an inflationary
period the  interest  expense of the Trust would  increase.  Since the  interest
income of the Trust would not  increase as rapidly,  an increase in the interest
expense  of the Trust  would  decrease  the net  income of the  Trust.  However,
interest  income should  subsequently  increase as variable rate loans  reprice.
Should the amount of the loans and the amount of the  indebtedness  of the Trust
remain  constant,  and  should  the  weighted  average  interest  rate  upon the
indebtedness increase to

                                      -12-
<PAGE>
approximately  25.08% per annum, the interest income and the interest expense of
the Trust would be substantially equal.

Odd-Lot Tender Offer

During  fiscal 1999,  the Trust  completed an odd-lot  tender  offer.  Effective
September 1, 1998, the Trust extended a tender offer to all shareholders  owning
less than 100 shares of  beneficial  interest to purchase  such shares for $2.50
per share.  The offer  expired  November  30, 1998. A total of 6,596 shares were
purchased as a result of such odd-lot tender offer,  thereby reducing the number
of outstanding shares of beneficial interest in the Trust to 7,000,806.

Year 2000 Issues

The following  information  which appears in this section  constitutes Year 2000
Readiness  Disclosure,  pursuant  to  the  Year  2000  ("Y2K")  Information  and
Readiness  Disclosure Act. The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer systems
using a two-digit  format,  as opposed to four digits, to indicate the year. Any
of the Trust's computer programs or hardware that have  date-sensitive  software
or embedded chips may not appropriately interpret dates beyond the year 1999.

This could result in a system failure,  miscalculation  or other computer errors
causing  disruptions  of  operations.  The  Trust's  plan to  address  the issue
involves the following five phases: awareness, assessment,  remediation, testing
and implementation.  The plan also involves  communicating with external service
providers to ensure that they are taking  appropriate  action to remedy any Year
2000 issues.  To date,  the Trust has completed  its  assessment of systems that
could be affected by the Year 2000. As part of the  assessment  phase,  systems,
which have the greatest impact, were designated as mission critical systems.

Internal mission  critical  systems include the Trust's internal  accounting and
information system. This system includes a small server-based local area network
and a small peer-to-peer network that uses commercially  available operating and
networking software. The vendors (primarily Microsoft,  Compaq and Gateway) have
certified this hardware and software as Year 2000 compliant. The Trust's primary
financing  application  programs  (including  general  ledger,   mortgage  loan,
shareholder,  bond financing and Secured Savings Certificate accounting modules)
are  customized.  During November 1998, an independent  consultant  performed an
analysis to  determine  if programs  were Year 2000  compliant.  The cost of the
testing was less than $1,000. The Trust has engaged the consultant to modify and
test the  noncompliant  programs.  Remediation  began  about  December  1998 and
through May 31, 1999 was 65%  complete.  The  consultant  has  committed  to the
completion of remediation and testing no later than December 15, 1999,  however,
it is  believed  that  remaining  modifications  and testing  will be  virtually
complete by the end of the third calendar quarter. It is estimated that the cost
to modify  the files will range  from  $6,000 to $7,500  (excluding  the cost to
upgrade and replace systems used in the ordinary course of business). Such costs
will be charged to expense as incurred.

                                      -13-
<PAGE>
The Trust's  operations are relatively  simple.  As far as essential vendors are
concerned,  the primary ones are considered to be the Trust's  primary bank (the
same bank serves as  depositor  and  lender),  and the  electric  and  telephone
utility.  The Trust has received  reports from these  providers  regarding their
efforts to attain Y2K readiness. The negative impact of large loan customers who
have not dealt with the  implications  of the Y2K  problem  on their  operations
could be serious to the Trust. However, the Trust does not believe that the risk
to its  typical  loan  customer  is as  great  as it is to a  normal  commercial
operation.  This is due to the fact that the source of loan  payments  generally
made by all churches is from individuals making  contributions via cash or check
to the church.  Accordingly, it is believed that most churches should not suffer
adversely  from  the Y2K  issue.  Nevertheless,  the  Trust  surveyed  its  loan
customers  with  balances over $100,000 in the first quarter of calendar 1999 to
determine their Y2K  compliance.  Most churches have responded that they will be
in  compliance.  The Trust intends to follow up soon on those  churches who have
not responded.

The Trust believes that it has an effective program in place to resolve the Year
2000 issue in a timely manner and that it is unlikely that Year 2000 issues will
cause any  significant  problems  with  customer  service  or  otherwise  have a
material  adverse  impact on the Trust's  operations  or financial  performance.
However,  if appropriate  modifications are not completed in a timely manner for
some unexpected reason, the Year 2000 issue could impact the Trust's operations.
In  addition,  disruptions  in the economy  generally  resulting  from Year 2000
issues could also  materially  impact the Trust.  There can be no guarantee that
the systems of other companies on which the Trust is effected will be remediated
in a timely  manner and not have any adverse  impact on the Trust's  operations.

At this time, the Trust has not developed  Year 2000  contingency  plans,  other
than the review and remedial actions  described above, and does not intend to do
so unless  the Trust  believes  such  plans are  merited  by the  results of its
continuing Year 2000 review. The Trust has not developed a "worst case" scenario
with  respect to Year 2000  issues,  but instead has  focused its  resources  on
identifying material,  remediable problems and reducing uncertainties  generally
through the Year 2000 review described above.

SIGNIFICANT SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On June 17, 1999, the Trust received  $1,380,493.29 in full and final payment of
a loan owing to the Trust from St. Stephens Church of God in Christ, Inc. of San
Diego,  California.  Such  amount  paid  in full  the  principal,  interest  and
attorney's fees owing to the Trust by such Borrower. Such loan was accounted for
as a  non-performing  loan by the Trust and certain  interest  payments had been
credited  to  principal.  Therefore,  such  payoff  resulted  in  an  additional
recognition of interest income of  approximately  $611,088.60  during June 1999.
The interest  income  recognized  as a result of this loan payoff is $0.0873 per
share.

                          Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Trust Managers and Shareholders
Church Loans & Investments Trust
Amarillo, Texas

We have audited the  accompanying  balance  sheets of Church Loans & Investments
Trust (a real estate  investment  trust) as of March 31, 1999 and 1998,  and the
related statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the years
then ended.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the  financial  position of Church Loans &  Investments
Trust as of March 31, 1999 and 1998,  and the results of its  operations and its
cash  flows for the years  then  ended in  conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles.

                   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Church Loans &  Investments  Trust  (Church  Loans) is a real estate  investment
trust that  invests  primarily  in mortgage  and interim  construction  loans to
churches and other borrowers (see note 1) across the United States, particularly
in the  southern  portion of the U.S.  Church  Loans  requires  that real estate
properties  be pledged  against  loans as security  which could be foreclosed by
Church  Loans  should  the  borrower  default.   Repayment  of  each  borrower's
obligations is generally  expected to be repaid from  contributions  from church
members  or  from  operations  of  the  borrower,  or in  the  case  of  interim
construction loans, by permanent financing provided by others.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CURRENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

Church Loans has historically invested in long-term,  fixed-rate mortgage loans,
generally funded by relatively  short-term secured savings  certificates  (SSCs)
and debt obligations. The volatility of interest rates and increased competition
to attract  customers'  funds have caused Church Loans'  liability  structure to
become short-term and rate sensitive. Church Loans reflected an average interest
yield on its loan and church bond  portfolio,  an average  interest  rate on its
total  indebtedness and a net interest rate margin at March 31, 1999 and 1998 as
follows:

                                   LOAN AND CHURCH      TOTAL       NET INTEREST
                                   BOND PORTFOLIO    INDEBTEDNESS   RATE MARGIN
                                   --------------    ------------   -----------
March 31, 1999 ....................    10.06%            6.90%          3.16%
March 31, 1998 ....................    10.95%            7.44%          3.51%

Church  Loans  finances  maturities  of SSCs and debt  obligations  through  its
available  lines of credit and principal  payments  received on its mortgage and
interim construction loans.

CHURCH BONDS

Church bonds,  secured by first mortgage liens on church facilities,  are stated
at cost,  as there is no traded market for the bonds and  management  intends to
hold such securities until maturity.

                   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
                             March 31, 1999 and 1998

LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR POSSIBLE CREDIT LOSSES

Loans are  stated at the  amount of unpaid  principal,  reduced  by  unamortized
purchase discounts and the allowance for possible credit losses. Interest income
is recognized when earned.

Impaired loans are measured  based on the present value of expected  future cash
flows  discounted at the loan's  effective  interest rate or the market price or
the  fair  value of the  collateral  if the loan is  collateral  dependent.  The
accrual of interest is  generally  discontinued  on loans and church  bonds more
than 90 days past due or when there is sufficient  doubt as to the collection of
interest. When interest accrual is discontinued,  all unpaid accrued interest is
reversed.  Cash  interest  payments  received  are  applied  to  principal  when
collection of principal is in doubt or are  recognized  as interest  income when
recovery of principal is reasonably assured.

The allowance for possible credit losses is established  through a provision for
possible  credit losses  charged to expense.  Loans and church bonds are charged
against  the  allowance  when  collectibility  of  the  principal  is  unlikely.
Recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance.  The
charge  to  operations  is based on  management's  and the  board of  directors'
evaluation of the loan and church bond portfolio,  including such factors as the
security  collateralizing the loans or church bonds, past credit loss experience
and general economic  conditions.  The allowance is subjective in nature and may
be  adjusted  in the near term  because of changes in the  borrower's  financial
status or economic conditions.

Commitment fees received on interim  construction  loans are recognized over the
interim commitment period for loans that are not permanently  financed by Church
Loans  and over the life of the  mortgage  loan for loans  that are  permanently
financed by Church Loans.  Amounts are being amortized  using the  straight-line
method.  This method was not  materially  different from the method of deferring
commitment fees until the commitment is exercised and  recognizing  such fees as
an adjustment to yield by the interest  method over the related  loans' lives as
prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles for the years ended March
31, 1999 and 1998.

Purchase discounts on loans are amortized based on the interest method.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property  and  equipment  are  stated at cost,  less  accumulated  depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on the  straight-line  method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 18 years.

REAL ESTATE ACQUIRED THROUGH FORECLOSURE

Real estate acquired through,  or in lieu of, loan foreclosure is to be sold and
is  initially   recorded  at  estimated   fair  value  at  date  of  foreclosure
establishing a new cost basis. Other real estate owned,  after  foreclosure,  is
carried at the lower of carrying  amount or the property's  estimated fair value
minus estimated costs to sell (fair value). Declines in the estimated fair value
below cost are recognized as a valuation allowance.  If the estimated fair value
subsequently  increases  above its carrying  value,  the valuation  allowance is
reduced,  but not below zero.  Increases or decreases in the valuation allowance
are charged or credited to operations.

The  valuation  of other real estate  owned is  subjective  in nature and may be
adjusted  in the near term  because of changes in economic  conditions  or other
factors.

                   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
                             March 31, 1999 and 1998

UNAMORTIZED DEBT EXPENSE

Commissions paid to brokers in connection with the sale of SSCs are deferred and
amortized  over the terms of the related  certificates  on the interest  method.
Costs  incurred in  connection  with the  registration  of SSCs are deferred and
amortized on the straight-line  method over the period the related  certificates
are sold,  but no longer than two years from the date the  registration  becomes
effective.

INCOME TAXES

Income taxes are accounted for under  Statement No. 109,  Accounting  for Income
Taxes.  Under the asset and  liability  method of  Statement  109,  deferred tax
assets  and  liabilities   are  recognized  for  the  future  tax   consequences
attributable to differences  between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing  assets and liabilities  and their  respective tax bases.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled.  Under Statement 109, the effect on deferred tax assets
and  liabilities  of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In  the   ordinary   course  of   business,   Church   loans  has  entered  into
off-balance-sheet  financial  instruments  consisting of  commitments  to extend
credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when
they become payable.

CASH FLOWS

For  purposes  of  reporting  cash  flows,  cash  and cash  equivalents  include
cash-on-hand  and investment in a money market mutual fund and  certificates  of
deposit with maturities of less than 90 days at the time of acquisition.

                  This information is an integral part of the
                       accompanying financial statements.

NOTE 1 - LOANS AND CHURCH BONDS

Mortgage loans  receivable  consist of  conventional  loans of  $25,129,877  and
$23,974,905  and church  bonds of  $401,172  and  $488,839 at March 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively. Interim construction loans of $12,126,462 and $11,695,994 at
March 31, 1999 and 1998,  respectively,  consist  primarily of loans to churches
for the construction of church facilities and assisted living centers.  Mortgage
loans,  church bonds and interim  construction  loans are  generally  secured by
first liens on real estate  comprised  primarily of church  buildings  and other
real  estate.  The  amount of a loan is  generally  limited  to  66-2/3%  of the
appraised  value of the  related  property.  Certain  loans  are  guaranteed  by
individual  members of the  congregations or other individuals or congregations,
depending on the circumstances.

Church  Loans'  portfolio  included  mortgage  loans,  church  bonds and interim
construction  loans with  interest  rates ranging from 7.50% to 17% at March 31,
1999.  The weighted  average  annual  interest  rates of Church  Loans' loan and
church  bond  portfolio  were  10.06%  and  10.95% at March  31,  1999 and 1998,
respectively.

Generally accepted accounting principles require disclosure of information about
certain current vulnerabilities due to certain concentrations.  In addition to a
concentration  of loans to  churches,  Church Loans makes  certain  interim real
estate  construction  loans and permanent loans to entities other than churches.
At March 31,  1999,  Church  Loans had eight loans to two  borrowers  which were
secured by assisted living centers and totaled approximately  $12,233,000.  Four
of these loans were to the same borrower and totaled approximately $9,001,000 at
March 31, 1999.  In addition,  Church Loans had four loan  commitments  to these
same two  borrowers  at March 31, 1999 for interim  construction  and  permanent
financing of assisted living centers which totaled approximately $3,825,000.

NOTE 2 - DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CONTINUED)
Descriptions of the various categories of debt obligations follow:

SECURED SAVINGS CERTIFICATES

SSCs were  issued in amounts of $1,000 or more and have  single  maturity  dates
from 30 days to 10 years  from  date of issue.  With  respect  to an  individual
certificate, interest rate and frequency of payment of interest (either monthly,
quarterly,  semiannually,  annually  or at  maturity)  are  fixed at the time of
issuance of the certificate.  Effective July 1997, Church Loans discontinued the
sale of SSCs.

The certificates are secured under the terms of certain indentures that require,
among other things,  the pledge of mortgage notes  receivable  with total unpaid
principal  amounts  not less  than  100% of the  aggregate  principal  amount of
certain respective SSC registrations outstanding. As of March 31, 1999 and 1998,
Church Loans was in compliance with the requirement.

LINE OF CREDIT PAYABLE TO BANK

The line of credit payable to bank consists of borrowings under a loan agreement
effective  through  September 1, 1999,  that provides for a $15,000,000  line of
credit with certain commitment fees. The loan agreement requires Church Loans to
pledge  mortgage  loans  receivable  having  unpaid  principal  balances with an
aggregate  present  value,  discounted at 2% over the prime rate (9.75% at March
31, 1999), of not less than 110% of all indebtedness owed to the bank.  Interest
accrued at the prime rate less one percent  from  September 1, 1997 to March 31,
1999,  and at the prime rate less one quarter of one percent  from April 1, 1997
to August 31, 1997. Interest is payable semiannually.

Additionally,  the line of credit  requires  that Church  Loans' net worth be no
less than  $18,000,000 and its total  indebtedness  shall not exceed 150% of its
net worth. At March 31, 1999, Church Loans' total indebtedness was approximately
$17,000,000 less than the maximum amount permitted under the agreement.

DEMAND NOTES PAYABLE

The demand notes  payable bear  interest at 1% less than the prime rate (payable
monthly) and are unsecured (see note 6).

NOTE 3 - INCOME TAX PROVISION

Church Loans has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a real estate  investment
trust under the Code, Church Loans must, among other things, distribute at least
95% of its taxable income to its shareholders through dividends. Church Loans is
required to pay  dividends  of at least 85% of its calendar  year  undistributed
income by February 1 or be subject to a special  federal excise tax of 4% on the
undistributed amount.

Deferred  taxes were not  significant  to Church Loans' 1999 and 1998  financial
statements.

NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS

Church Loans is a party to financial instruments with  off-balance-sheet risk in
the normal course of business.  Commitments  to extend credit are  agreements to
lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established
in the contract.  Commitments  generally  have variable  interest  rates,  fixed
expiration  dates or other  termination  clauses and  require  payment of a fee.
Since some of the  commitments  may expire  without being drawn upon,  the total
commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Church
Loans  evaluates each  customer's  credit  worthiness on a  case-by-case  basis.
Collateral  generally  includes real estate  properties.  The exposure to credit
loss in the event of  nonperformance  by the other party to the  commitments  to
extend  credit is  represented  by the  contractual  amount.  At March 31, 1999,
Church  Loans  had  outstanding  loan  commitments  (by  contract   amounts)  of
approximately  $11,452,000,  including $3,825,000 to finance the construction of
or provide permanent financing for assisted living centers.  Management does not
anticipate any losses as a result of these transactions.

NOTE 9 - DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial  instruments,  the results of applying  such methods and
assumptions to the financial  instruments and limitations inherent in fair value
estimates:

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The assets are considered  short-term  instruments for which the carrying amount
is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

                             March 31, 1999 and 1998

NOTE 9 - DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

LOANS AND CHURCH BONDS

Fair  values  are  estimated  for  portfolios  of loans with  similar  financial
characteristics.  Loans are  segregated  by type,  such as mortgage  and interim
construction  loans and church bonds.  Each loan  category is further  segmented
into  fixed  and  adjustable  rate  interest  terms.  For  variable-rate  loans,
primarily  interim  construction  loans,  that  reprice  frequently  and with no
significant  change in credit risk,  fair values are based on carrying  amounts.
The fair value of fixed-rate  mortgage loans and bonds is generally estimated by
discounting  the future cash flows  through  the  estimated  maturity  using the
current  rates at which  similar  loans would be made to borrowers  with similar
credit  ratings.  The estimate of maturity is based on Church Loans'  historical
experience with repayments for each loan classification,  modified, as required,
by an estimate of the effect of current  economic  and lending  conditions.  The
carrying  value of loans,  net of the allowance for loan losses was  $35,855,928
and  $34,355,426 and the fair value of loans was  approximately  $36,800,000 and
$34,800,000 at March 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

NOTES PAYABLE AND LINE OF CREDIT

The fair value of notes payable and the line of credit are equal to the carrying
value as such liabilities are deemed to be short-term borrowings.

SECURED SAVINGS CERTIFICATES

The fair value of secured  savings  certificates  is  estimated  using the rates
currently  offered for financial  instruments  of similar  characteristics.  The
carrying value of secured savings certificates was $2,763,376 and $7,063,823 and
the fair value of secured savings certificates was approximately  $2,811,000 and
$7,200,000 at March 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

Generally,  Church Loans enters into  commitments to extend credit at adjustable
interest terms.  Accordingly,  the commitment amount is a reasonable estimate of
fair value.

LIMITATIONS

Fair value  estimates  are made at a specific  point in time,  based on relevant
market  information  and  information  about  the  financial  instrument.  These
estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering
for sale at one time Church  Loans'  entire  holdings of a particular  financial
instrument.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of Church Loans'
financial  instruments,  fair value  estimates are based on judgments  regarding
future   expected   loss   experience,   current   economic   conditions,   risk
characteristics  of various  financial  instruments,  and other  factors.  These
estimates  are  subjective  in nature and involve  uncertainties  and matters of
significant  judgment  and,  therefore,  cannot be  determined  with  precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

NOTE 10 - YEAR 2000

Like most businesses,  Church Loans may be exposed to risks associated with Year
2000 dating  problems.  This problem  affects  computer  software and  hardware;
transactions  with  customers,   vendors,  and  other  entities;  and  equipment
dependent on  microchips.  Church Loans has begun,  but not yet  completed,  the
process of identifying and remediating  potential Year 2000 problems.  It is not
possible  for any  business  to  guarantee  the  results of its own  remediation
efforts or to  accurately  predict  the impact of Year 2000  dating  problems on
third parties with which Church Loans conducts business.  If remediation efforts
of Church Loans or third parties with which it does business are not successful,
it is possible  the Year 2000 dating  problem  could  negatively  impact  Church
Loans' financial position and results of operations.
