RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Income increased $28,460, 102.8%, in 1998 as compared with 1997. The 
increase in net income in 1998 as compared with 1997 was due primarily to 
an increase in gross income.

Rent income increased $2,155, 3.0%, in 1998 as compared with 1997 primarily 
because of a decrease in vacancies. Interest income increased $41,698, 
83.5%, in 1998 as compared with 1997. The increase in interest in 1998 as 
compared with 1997 was primarily due to an increase in interest-bearing 
deposits.

1997 due to a decrease in depreciation rates. Other expenses decreased 
$6,652, 13.4%, in 1998 as compared with 1997 primarily due to a decrease 
in maintenance expenses.

1.	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Nature of Operations, Risks and Uncertainties

The Company is engaged in the ownership and rental of properties located
almost exclusively within Yellowstone County, Montana.The Company's rental 
operations are dependent in large part upon the economy and rental conditions
within Yellowstone County, Montana. The Company leases its properties to 
lessees under non-cancelable operating leases with terms of less than one 
year. 

The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of certain types of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled 
transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

(b)	Depreciation

Depreciation for the various classifications of rental property, plant and 
equipment is computed using the straight-line and accelerated methods over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings						                           15 - 27 Years
Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment	         3 - 10 Years

(c)	Income Taxes

The Company files a consolidated income tax return with its parent company.  
Income taxes are allocated to the Company based upon the ratio of the 
Company's pre-tax income to total consolidated pre-tax income.

(d)	Policy of Cash Equivalents

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents include time
deposits, certificates of deposit and money market accounts, all with original
maturities of three months or less.

(e) Comprehensive Income

There were no items of other comprehensive income in 1998 or 1997, and net 
income is therefore equal to comprehensive income for each of those years.

f) Retirement Plans

The Company adopted an employees' savings plan under Section 401(k) of the 
Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") during 1998. The Company allows eligible 
employees to contribute the maximum percentage of their

compensation allowed by the Code. The Company matches employee contributions 
in an amount equal to fifty percent of the first six percent of the 
employee's compensation up to a maximum of $1,080. Participants are at all 
times fully vested in their contributions and are gradually vested in the 
Company's contributions. The Company's 401(k) contributions and 
administrative costs were $0 for 1998.

(g) Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts to make 
them comparable to the 1997 presentation. These changes had no	impact on 
previously reported results of operations or shareholders'	equity.

2.CASH BALANCES

The Company maintains cash accounts with various financial institutions 
and stock brokerage firms. Cash balances are insured up to $100,000 by 
either the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SIPC") or the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). At December 31, 1998, cash 
balances totaling $1,832,749 were uninsured by either the SIPC or the FDIC.

3.  CONTRACT RECEIVABLE

The contract receivable at December 31, 1997 consisted of the following:

9% Contract For Deed, due in monthly
 installments of $248 including interest to
 September, 2002                               $  11,466

4.	INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense consists of the following, all currently payable:

                                                     1998           1997   

U.S. Income Taxes                                $  29,700      $  17,000

4.INCOME TAXES - (continued)

income tax rates to income before income taxes. The reasons for these 
differences are as follows:

 						                                              1998           1997
