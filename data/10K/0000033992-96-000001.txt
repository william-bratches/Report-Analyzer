PART I

ITEM 1.   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

(a)  Business Development

     (i) International Airport Hotel

     EXTECH Corporation (the "Company" or "EXTECH"), through
a wholly-owned subsidiary, IAH, Inc. ("IAH"), operates the
International Airport Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico (the "Hotel").
The Hotel is located on the site of the San Juan International Airport
(the "Airport") and occupies the third and fifth floors of the main
terminal building.  In addition to its 57 guest rooms, the Hotel has
a lobby area.  The Hotel caters generally to commercial and tourist
travelers in transit.  IAH also operates a video game room on the
terminal level of the Airport.  Reference is also made to Item 6
hereof for additional information regarding the Hotel.

     The Hotel is marketed through brochures, local advertising
and in-airport advertising.  Its operations are highly
seasonal, with the disproportionate share of its revenues being
generated during the first several months of the calendar year.
Approximately 15% of the total room sales for the Hotel for 1995 were
attributable to one customer. 
 
     The Hotel is the only hotel actually located on the site of the
Airport.  As such, it has little direct competition for the tourist
trade or commercial travelers seeking only sleeping accommodations
at the Airport.  The Puerto Rico Ports Authority (the "Ports
Authority"),the owner of the Hotel, had authorized the construction of
an additional hotel in the parking lot of the Airport; however, the
Ports Authority has advised IAH that it has abandoned its plan to
construct such hotel and instead has determined to upgrade and expand
the Hotel.  No assurance can be given, however, that an additional hotel
or hotels will not be developed at the site of, or near, the Airport,
in which case IAH could encounter significant competition with respect
to the operations of the Hotel.

     On July 22, 1988, IAH entered into a Lease Agreement with the
Ports Authority pursuant to which the Ports Authority granted IAH
a lease to operate the Hotel for five years until June 30, 1993, plus,
at the option of IAH, an additional five year term to end June 30, 1998
(subject to agreement as to the rental amount payable, which the parties
agreed to negotiate in good faith).

     In 1992, in accordance with the Lease Agreement, IAH exercised
its right for a five year extension of its lease.  At the time, the
Ports Authority was uncertain as to whether it wished to build a
new hotel in the parking lot of the Airport or upgrade the existing
hotel (located in the Airport terminal) and, therefore, requested that
IAH accept an 18 month extension of the then existing term.  IAH agreed
to an 18 month extension and signed a supplemental lease agreement with
the Ports Authority in May 1992 extending the lease term to December 31,
1995.

IAH is of the belief that, pursuant to the supplemental lease agreement,
it retained the option to continue the lease for a period of five years
to December 31, 2000.

     In July 1993, the Assistant Director of Operations of the
Ports Authority forwarded to IAH a letter containing the terms of a
proposed ten year lease extension which IAH approved, signed and
returned to the Ports Authority.  Although the letter setting forth the
terms of the extension agreement with IAH does not make the Ports
Authority's approval conditional upon the approval of its Board of
Directors, the Ports Authority has taken such position and, since Board
of Directors approval was not obtained, the Ports Authority takes the
position that the extension is not in effect.  IAH is of the belief that
a ten year agreement has been entered into between IAH and the Ports
Authority pursuant to the foregoing or that, alternatively, it exercised
its right to extend the term of the lease to December 31, 2000.

     Based upon IAH's refusal to acknowledge that, effective January
1, 1996, it occupied the Hotel on a month-to-month basis, in February
1996, the Ports Authority requested that IAH vacate, surrender and
deliver the premises by February 29, 1996.  Following the receipt of
such request, IAH brought an action in the Superior Court of San Juan,
Puerto Rico for declaratory judgment and possessory injunction against
the Ports Authority with respect to the Hotel.  The action seeks a
declaratory judgment that, among other alternatives, IAH exercised
adoption with respect to its lease for the Hotel for an extension of the
term of five years commencing on January 1, 1996 or that the
Ports Authority executed a new lease agreement for a ten year period
commencing on such date.

     (ii) Pipe Harness Clamp

     The Company holds a patent for a specialized clamping device
(the "Pipe Harness Clamp") designed to connect principally underground
pipe lines of similar and dissimilar materials.  In July 1991,
the Company and an unrelated third party (the "Licensee") entered
into a License and Royalty Agreement (the "License Agreement") pursuant
to which the Licensee was granted the exclusive right to manufacture,
use, market and sell (either directly or on the Licensee's behalf) the
Pipe Harness Clamp.

     The License Agreement provides that, among other matters, the
Licensee will pay royalty payments for the license of the Pipe Harness
Clamp in an amount equal to 5% of Net Sales (as defined in the License
Agreement) of the Pipe Harness Clamp until such time as the aggregate
amount of the royalty payments total $1,000,000 and thereafter an amount
equal to 2.5% of Net Sales of the Pipe Harness Clamp (the "Net Sales
Royalty").  The License Agreement also provides that the Licensee will
pay a percentage of royalty payments that are payable to the license
pursuant to a certain License and Technical Assistance Agreement(the
"Technical Assistance Agreement").  The Company is to receive,
for each twelve month period that the Technical Assistance Agreement
is in effect, 23.68% of all amounts in excess of $100,000 received by
the Licensee in accordance with the terms of the Technical Assistance
Agreement (the "Technical Assistance Royalty"), the aggregate of which
payments to the Company shall not exceed $1,480,000.  As of December
31, 1995, the Company had received approximately $70,000 in
Technical Assistance Royalty payments pursuant to the License
Agreement (of which approximately $19,000 was received during 1995)
but had received no Net Sales Royalty payments.  No assurances can be
given regarding the commercial marketability of the Pipe Harness Clamp. 






(iii)     Robeson Industries Corp.

     In February 1993, EXTECH entered into a Subscription and Stock
Purchase Agreement (the "Subscription Agreement") with Robeson
Industries Corp. ("Robeson") pursuant to which the Company agreed
to purchase from Robeson, subject to the conditions set forth
therein, (i) approximately 15% of the issued and outstanding shares
of capital stock of Robeson and (ii) all of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Robeson's wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary, Robeson
Industries Hong Kong Ltd. ("Hong Kong") (the "Hong Kong Shares").


     In May 1993, the Company advised Robeson that it was terminating
the Subscription Agreement due to the nonfulfillment of certain of the
conditions to the obligation of EXTECH to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby.  The Company also made demand upon Robeson for
repayment of the principal amount of $320,000 loaned by the Company
during 1992 and 1993, together with interest thereon, as well as
reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Company in connection with
the Subscription Agreement.


     Subsequently, in May 1993, Robeson filed a petition for bankruptcy
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act with the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey (the "Court").  In
September 1993, the Company filed a proof of claim in such proceeding
as a secured creditor to recover the approximate amount of $534,000.

     Pursuant to a Plan of Reorganization of Robeson (the "Plan")
approved by the Court, in September 1994, in consideration of the
$320,000 in loans made by the Company to Robeson and other recoverable
expenses, the reorganized Robeson issued to the Company a promissory
note (the "Note") in the principal amount of $385,000.  The Note
provided for the payment of interest at the rate of 8% per annum and
the repayment of principal in 48 consecutive monthly installments of
varying amounts.  Pursuant to the Plan, payment of the Note was secured
by a pledge of all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Hong Kong
(the "Hong Kong Stock").  In addition, pursuant to the Plan, the
Company received a nominal minority equity interest in Robeson.

     The first three payments under the Note were received by the
Company in October, November and December 1994.  Effective January
1995, Robeson ceased making payments under the Note.  In March 1995,
the Company demanded full payment of the Note, foreclosed its security
interest with respect to the Hong Kong Stock and purchased such shares
at an auction sale.

     In September 1995, the Company agreed to cancel the Note in
consideration for the issuance by Robeson of a new promissory note in
the principal amount of $125,000 (the "New Note").  The New Note
provides for interest at the rate of 8% per annum and is payable in 27
consecutive monthly installments of $5,000.  The Company has received
all installments due to date under the New Note.





(iv) Phone America International, Inc.

     In February 1996, the Company announced that it had entered into a
non-binding letter of intent to acquire Phone America International,
Inc. ("Phone America"), an interexchange telecommunications carrier
engaged in the design, development and marketing of prepaid telephone
calling cards and other telephone products. Phone America offers the
end user both basic and long distance services, enhanced information
services and hardware-based telephone services.

     Phone America's preliminary unaudited financial statements as of
December 31, 1995 and for the year then ended reflect revenues of
approximately 375,000, a net loss of approximately $525,000 and a
shareholders' deficiency of approximately $125,000.

     The letter of intent contemplates that, following the acquisition,
the holders of Phone America shares, options and warrants will receive
shares of Common Stock of the Company, or options and warrants to
purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company, representing, in the
aggregate, 40% of the Company's Common Stock.  Pursuant to the letter
of intent, such percentage would increase to 50% if certain performance
targets are met.
          
     The letter of intent also contemplates that, at the closing of the
transaction, subject to the requirements of applicable law, certain
Phone America officers and directors will constitute a majority of the
Company's Board of Directors and David A. Lyons and Adam R. Kolodny,
currently  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
respectively, of Phone America will assume the offices of Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, respectively, of the
Company. Mr. Lyons, who previously served as President, Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer of AMNEX, Inc., a publicly traded
telecommunications service provider,  is related to the wife of Morton
L. Certilman, President of the Company.  Mr. Kolodny previously served
as President of The Keystone Corporation, a private payphone company,
and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of AMNEX.         

     The consummation of the transaction is subject to satisfactory
completion of the parties' due diligence investigation, final
negotiation of the terms thereof, the execution and delivery of a
definitive acquisition agreement, approval by the parties' respective
Board of Directors and approval by Phone America's stockholders.  No
assurances can be given that the transaction will be consummated upon
the terms set forth in the letter of intent or otherwise.

     Concurrently with the execution of the letter of intent, the
Company loaned $50,000 to Transcends Telecom Corporation ("Transcends"), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Phone America, for workingcapital purposes.
The note evidencing the loan is payable on or afterAugust 26, 1996 upon
30 days notice.  Payment of the principal amountof the note, together
with interest at the rate of 10% per annum, is secured by a pledge of
all shares of  Phone America Common Stock owned by Mr. Lyons and
another principal stockholder, as well as by a lien on accounts
receivable of Transcends.

ITEM 6.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF
          OPERATION

Results of Operations:

     In 1995, the Company had total revenues of $1,024,057 and a net
profit of $51,229 as compared to revenues of $991,735 a net profit of
$51,364 for 1994.

     Room rental and other departmental revenue for the Hotel increased
by $92,127 (10.3%) during 1995.  The Company believes that such
increased revenue was previously the result of a general increase in
air travel.  The net profit for the Hotel, on a "stand-alone" basis,
was $144,351 in 1995 as compared to $142,470 in 1994.

     Other income decreased from $57,219 in 1994 to zero in 1995 due a
credit against rent in such amount realized by IAH during 1994.

     In 1995, the Company incurred costs and expenses of $967,152 as
compared to $935,083 in 1994, representing an increase of $32,069.  The
increase was attributable primarily to increased rental payments to the
Ports Authority in connection with the lease of the Hotel.

     Reference is made to Item 1(a)(i) and (iv) hereof for a discussion
of a certain litigation with the Ports Authority with regard to the
Hotel as well as a contemplated acquisition transaction with Phone
America.
  
Liquidity and Capital Resources: 

     As of December 31, 1995, the Company had $644,956 in cash and cash
equivalents as compared to $482,359 in 1994, representing an increase
of $162,597.  As of such date, the Company had a working capital
surplus of $453,377.  The Company did not have any material commitments
for capital expenditures as of December 31, 1995.

     Reference is made to Item 1(a)(iii) hereof for a discussion of the
status of a certain note in the original principal amount of $125,000
issued by Robeson to the Company in September 1995 .

     Reference is also made to Item 1(a)(i) and (iv) hereof for a

Board of Directors and Stockholders
EXTECH CORPORATION
East Meadow, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
EXTECH CORPORATION and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and
the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period
ended December 31, 1995.  These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of EXTECH CORPORATION and Subsidiaries as of December 31,
1995 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 1995
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

g.   Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2. Supplementary Information - Statement of Cash Flows: 

   Cash paid for income taxes was $5,452 and $10,506 during the
years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

3. Property and Equipment:

   At December 31, 1995, property and equipment consists of the
following:

     Furniture, fixtures and equipment      $   356,223
     Leasehold improvements                     135,760
                                                491,983
     Less accumulated depreciation and
     amortization                               290,293

                                                =======           
4. Notes Receivable:

   During the period December 1992 to March 1993, the Company
 entered into various loans with Robeson Industries Corp. ("Robeson")
 (an unrelated third party) in the aggregate amount of
 $320,000.  The notes were secured by a pledge of all of the issued
 and outstanding shares of Robeson Industries Hong Kong Ltd.
 ("Robeson Hong Kong").  In May 1993, Robeson filed a petition for
 bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act.  In September
 1993, the Company filed a proof of claim in such proceeding as a
 secured creditor to recover such advances, related accrued
 interest and other costs.

   In September 1994, pursuant to a Plan of Reorganization (the
 "Plan"),  Robeson issued to the Company a promissory note (the
 "Note") in the principal amount of $385,000.  The Note provides
 for the payment of interest at the rate of 8% per annum and the
 repayment of principal in 48 consecutive monthly installments. 
 Such installments cover an aggregate of 5% of the principal amount
 of the Note during the initial six months, an additional 7.5%
 thereof during the following six months, an additional 37.5%
 thereof during the following 12 months, an additional 25% thereof
 during the following 12 months and the final 25% thereof during
 the last 12 months of the Note.  The Note is secured by all the
 outstanding shares of capital stock of Robeson's wholly-owned Hong
 Kong subsidiary.  In addition, pursuant to the Plan, the Company
 received a nominal minority equity interest in Robeson.

                                  F-8<PAGE>


   The first three payments under the Note were received by the
 Company in October, November and December 1994.  Effective January
 1995, Robeson ceased making payments under the Note.  In March
 1995, the Company demanded full payment of the Note, foreclosed
 its security interest with respect to the Hong Kong stock and
 purchased such shares at an auction sale.  In September 1995, the
 Company agreed to cancel the Note in consideration for the
 issuance by Robeson of a new promissory note in the principal
 amount of $125,000 (the "New Note").  The New Note provides for
 interest at the rate of 8% per annum and is payable in 27
 consecutive monthly installments of $5,000.  The Company has
 received all installments due to date under the New Note.

5. Accrued Expenses

   At December 31, 1995, accrued expenses consists of the
 following:

     Rent                            $          74,655
     Professional fees                          18,061

     Other                                       7,951

                                     $          139,501
                                                =======

6. Deferred Compensation

   The Company has an agreement to pay special compensation to
 certain employees who at the date of retirement have accumulated
 20 years of uninterrupted service.  Maximum amount payable per
 employee is $3,000.  At the effective date, there were seven
 employees covered by this plan, four of them with 15 years of
 accumulated service.  The accrual is being done pro-ratably from
 the inception of the plan to the date each employee is eligible
 for benefits.  At December 31, 1995, there was $16,039 shown as
 accrued expenses payable. 

7. Debentures Payable:

   In 1971, the Company, pursuant to a plan of arrangement, issued
 a series of debentures which matured in 1977.  As of December 31,
 1995, $154,200 of these debentures have not been presented for

                               F-9









 payment.  Accordingly, this balance has been included as a current
 liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 
 Interest has not been accrued on the remaining debentures payable. 
 In addition, no interest or other charges have been accrued with
 regard to any escheat obligation of the Company. 

8. Related Party Transaction:

   During the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Company
 leased its corporate office facility from a partnership of which
 a stockholder/officer is a member.  Rent expense amounted to
 $6,000 for each of the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994. 

9. Income Taxes:

   The 1995 and 1994 income of IAH, Inc., a wholly-owned
 subsidiary has been calculated excluding the loss of Extech, as
 it is separately taxed under the laws of Puerto Rico.  A
 provision of $5,676 and $5,288 respectively, has been made for
 this tax liability. 

   For federal income taxes, the Company has a net operating
 loss carryforward of approximately $700,000 available to offset
 future taxable income and approximately $1,500,000 of capital
 loss carryforwards available to offset future capital gains.  In
 addition, the Company has general business tax credit
 carryforwards available to reduce future income taxes of
 approximately $79,000.  If not utilized, these credits are
 scheduled to expire in various amounts through 2010.  The
 Company incurred operating losses during the past three years
 and losses are expected in the early subsequent periods.  As a
 result, the Company has not recorded a deferred tax asset in
 1995 due to the fact that a 100% valuation allowance would be
 needed. 

10.  Commitment and Contingency:

 IAH, Inc. leases the International Airport Hotel property
 pursuant to an operating lease with the Puerto Rico Ports\
 Authority ("Ports Authority"), which expired in December 1995.  IAH
 is of the belief that pursuant to a supplemental lease agreement,
 it retained the opinion to continue the lease for a period of five
 years to December 31, 2000.  On August 3, 1994, an amendment to
 the lease agreement provided for the annual rental payments to be
 equal to the greater of $169,400 or 20% of the annual gross




                               F-10









 revenues, as defined, effective January 1, 1994.  Total rent
 expense under this lease amounted to $191,335 for 1995 and
 $172,194 for 1994.

   Based upon IAH's refusal to acknowledge that, effective January
 1, 1996, it occupied the Hotel on a month-to-month basis, in
 February 1996, the Port Authority requested that IAH vacate,
 surrender and deliver the premises by February 29, 1996. 
 Following the receipt of such request, IAH brought an action in
 the Superior Court of San Juan, Puerto Rico for declaratory
 judgment and possessory injunction against the Ports Authority
 with respect to the Hotel.  The action seeks a declaratory
 judgment that, among other alternatives, IAH exercised an option
 with respect to its lease for the Hotel for an extension of the
 term of five years commencing on January 1, 1996 or that the Ports
 Authority executed a new lease agreement for a ten year period
 commencing on such date.

11.  Stockholders' Equity:

   a.   Stock options

     The Company maintains a stock option plan which provides for
 the granting of options to individuals rendering service to the
 Company to purchase up to 300,000 shares of common stock of the
 Company.  Such options may be either incentive stock options or
 non-statutory stock options.  No options have been granted as of
 December 31, 1995.

   b.   Common shares reserved

     Stock Option Plan               300,000

12.  Income Per Share:

   Net income per common share was computed using the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each
period presented.

13.  Major Customer:

   Sales to a major customer approximated 15% and 10% of total room
sales for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

14.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

   In 1995, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board Statement No. 107, which requires disclosures about the fair
value of the Company's financial instruments.  The methods and
assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the following
classes of financial instruments were:

   Current Assets and Current Liabilities:  The carrying amount
of cash and temporary cash investments, current receivables and
payable and certain other short-term financial instruments
approximate their fair value.

   The carrying amount and fair value of the Company's financial
instruments at December 31, 1995 are as follows:

                                           Carrying       Fair
                                            Amount        Value
   

     Cash and cash equivalents              $644,956    $644,956
     Accounts receivables                     52,421      52,421

     Other current liabilities               143,057     143,057




15.  Letter of Intent:

   In February 1996, the Company signed a letter of intent to
acquire a telecommunications interexchange carrier engaged in the
design, development and marketing of prepaid telephone calling
cards and other telephone products.  The Company is in the process
of beginning its due diligence investigations.  The terms of the
letter of intent provide for the issuances of shares of common
stock of the Company, and options for the purchase of shares of
common stock, which would represent 40% of the outstanding common
shares of the Company.  The letter of intent also provides for the
issuance of additional shares and options representing up to an
additional 10% of the outstanding common shares provided certain
revenues and pre-tax earnings levels are met.
