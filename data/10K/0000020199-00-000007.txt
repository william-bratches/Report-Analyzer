<P><FONT SIZE=3>Item 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</font></p>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>Church Loans &amp; Investments Trust (&#147;the Trust&#148;) is
a real estate investment trust organized under the laws of the State of Texas in
March 1963. Although the Trust has the authority to engage in the business of
buying, selling and leasing of real estate, the Trust has heretofore restricted
its business activities primarily to making loans to churches and other
nonprofit organizations and assisted living centers which are secured by a first
mortgage on real estate owned by such borrowers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The period of duration of the Trust, unless dissolved in
accordance with law, or by the consent of the owners of shares of beneficial
interest in the Trust, is perpetual. The Trust may be dissolved by the
affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the owners of outstanding shares
of the Trust. Owners of Secured Savings Certificates, a debt instrument issued
by the Trust, have no vote in regard to any activities of the Trust, including
dissolution. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The control and management of the Trust properties, and all
powers necessary or appropriate to effect any and all of the purposes for which
the Trust is organized, is vested in the Board of Trust Managers. </FONT></P>

         The number of shares of beneficial interest in the Trust which the Trust is authorized to
         issue is unlimited.

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Trust is qualified as a &#147;real estate investment
trust&#148; under Sections 856-858 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as
amended (the &#147;Internal Revenue Code&#148; or &#147;Code&#148;). It is the
intention of the Trust to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust
under the Code. </FONT></P>

         The Trust maintains an office located at 5305 I-40 West, Amarillo, TX 79106 (telephone
         806/358-3666).

<P><FONT SIZE=3>As mentioned above, the Trust is primarily engaged in the
business of making mortgage loans to churches and other nonprofit organizations
and assisted living centers. The Declaration of Trust restricts the investments
of the Trust to loans secured by a first mortgage, deed of trust or other lien
covering real property with the amount of such loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of
the value of the real property securing such loan as determined by a competent
independent appraiser. Although the Trust has been primarily in the business of
making long-term mortgage loans, during the past several years it has also been
actively involved in making short-term interim or construction loans to finance
the </FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-4-</FONT></H1>


<PAGE>



<P><FONT SIZE=3>construction of church buildings, the construction of assisted
living centers, the purchase of real estate, or the refinancing of existing
indebtedness. Most of the interim loans presently being made by the Trust are
associated with bond offerings of churches and other nonprofit organizations and
assisted living centers. These interim loans are scheduled to be repaid from the
proceeds of the bond offerings. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Trust is not limited to the location of the property
securing any loans in which it may invest and seeks to spread its investments in
areas of the United States where favorable yields prevail. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>As of March 31, 2000, the Trust has 105 permanent and interim
mortgage loans and investments in church bonds having a principal balance of
$37,398,260, with the average principal amount thereof being $356,173.90. The
interest rates on these loans vary from 8% to 17% per annum with the weighted
average interest rate of mortgage loans and church bonds being 10.14% per annum
at March 31, 2000. The original terms of these loans vary from one year to
thirty years, with the majority being for a term of twenty years. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>During the fiscal year of the Trust ending March 31, 2000, the
net income of the Trust was $3,059,815, as compared to $2,505,826 in fiscal
1999, an increase of 22.11%. The increase in net income of the Trust was due to
several factors, including (a) a slight increase in the average interest yield
on the Trust&#146;s loan and church bond portfolio; and (b) the payment of
certain previously non-performing loans for which the Trust was not accruing
interest. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The net income of the Trust for each of the quarters during
fiscal 2000 was as follows: first quarter $1,152,805; second quarter $516,688;
third quarter $586,461; and fourth quarter $803,861. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The operational expense of the Trust increased from $684,706
during fiscal 1999 to $751,117 in fiscal 2000. However, the operational expenses
of the Trust were approximately 14.60% of its gross income including Other
Income for the year ended March 31, 2000 as compared to 14.95% for the year
ended March 31, 1999. The operational expense of the Trust included general and
administrative expenses and compensation to members of the Board of Trust
Managers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>During fiscal 2000, the Trust advanced loan proceeds of
$26,748,968 on 30 different loans. Most, if not all, of such loans bear interest
at a variable rate varying from 1.5% to 2% per annum in excess of the prime rate
of interest published by the Wall Street Journal and known as the &#147;Wall
Street Journal Prime.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>During fiscal 2000, the Trust employed a total of 5 full time
employees and employed, as needed, two additional part-time employees. </FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-5-</FONT></H1>


<PAGE>



<P><FONT SIZE=3>The business conditions in which the Trust operates has become
more competitive in the past fiscal year as more and more banks are re-entering
the business of making loans to churches, especially the more desirable, less
risky, church loans. If this trend continues, the rates and fees which the trust
can charge may decrease. However, loan demand remains good as evidenced by the
number of loan requests received by the Trust and the number of loan commitments
outstanding as of March 31, 2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Item 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY</font></p>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Trust maintains as its only place of business its offices
located at 5305 I-40 West, in Amarillo, Texas. Such building is owned by the
Trust and is occupied solely by the Trust. There is no debt owed by Trust in
regard to its real property. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The real properties of the Trust, net of depreciation and
excluding real estate acquired through foreclosure, are not a significant
portion of the Trust&#146;s assets, representing less than 1% of the
Trust&#146;s total assets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>As previously mentioned, the Trust&#146;s primary business is
the making of mortgage loans to churches and other nonprofit organizations and
assisted living centers. The Declaration of Trust restricts the investments of
the Trust to loans secured by a first mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien
covering real property with the amount of such loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of
the value of the real property securing such loan. The Declaration of Trust may
not be amended without the affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3rds) of the
Certificates of Beneficial Interest entitled to vote. The Board of Trust
Managers&#146; general policy is to limit investment of Trust assets in any one
mortgage loan to not more than $2,000,000. All such investment in mortgage loans
is for the purpose of earning income for the Trust. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Due to several foreclosures of nonperforming loans, the Trust
holds title or an interest in the title to two properties which are presently
for sale by the Trust. These properties are located in Cincinnati, Ohio and
Decatur, Georgia. Since the Trust&#146;s 2000 year-end, the property in Decatur,
Georgia has been sold. </FONT></P>

         There is no established public trading market for the shares of beneficial interest of the

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>Results of Operations--2000 compared to 1999</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000, interest income and
fees of the Trust increased by $155,583 (3.41%) over the previous fiscal year.
Such increase was primarily attributable to several factors, including (a) a
slight increase in the average interest yield on the Trust&#146;s loan and
church bond portfolio and (b) the payment of certain previously non-performing
loans for which the Trust was not accruing interest. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>There was a decrease in the amount of performing interim loans
held by the Trust from $10,406,937 as of March 31, 1999 to $8,827,383 as of
March 31, 2000 and there was a decrease in performing mortgage loans during the
recent fiscal year from $23,109,175 as of March 31, 1999 to $22,141,873 as of
March 31, 2000. Therefore, the total performing mortgage loans, church bonds and
performing interim construction loans held by the Trust decreased from
$33,516,112 as of March 31, 1999 to $30,969,256 as of March 31, 2000. More
significantly, there was a decrease in the investment in mortgage and interim
loans made by the Trust during fiscal 2000 of $26,748,968 as compared to
$35,518,740 during fiscal 1999. This represents a decrease of $8,769,772 or
24.69%. The decrease in the investment by the Trust in mortgage loans also
contributed to a decrease of $41,105 in commitment fees earned by the Trust in
fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999. Income from the realization of loan
discounts from loan purchases also decreased from $330,074 for the year ended
March 31, 1999 to $125,022 for the year ended March 31, 2000, a decrease of
$205,052. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>These decreases were offset by an increase in the average
interest rate on loans and church bonds held by the Trust from 10.06% as of
March 31, 1999 to 10.14% as of March 31, 2000, an increase in interest on
temporary investments held by the Trust from $34,996 as of March 31, 1999 to
$83,601 as of March 31, 2000 and by the payment of a significant loan owing to
the Trust that was previously characterized as non-performing. On June 17, 1999,
the Trust received $1,380,493 in full and final payment of a loan owing to the
Trust from St. Stephens Church of God in Christ, Inc. of San Diego, California.
Such amount paid in full the principal, interest and attorney&#146;s fees owing
to the Trust by such Borrower. The loan had been accounted for as a
nonperforming loan by the Trust and certain interest payments had been credited
to principal. Therefore, the pay-off resulted in an additional recognition of
interest income of approximately $611,000 in fiscal 2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>In fiscal 2000, the average aggregate amount of total debt
outstanding was $759,180 less than in fiscal&#160;1999. Accordingly, the
interest expense of the Trust decreased by $29,673 as </FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-8-</FONT></H1>


<PAGE>



<P><FONT SIZE=3>compared to fiscal 1999. Such decrease was primarily due to a
decrease in the debt of the Trust. Such decrease was significantly offset by an
increase in the Trust&#146;s cost of funds. The approximate weighted average
annual interest rate upon the aggregate outstanding debt increased from 6.90% at
the end of fiscal 1999 to 8.00% at the end of fiscal 2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The net income of the Trust for fiscal 2000 was $3,059,815 ($.44
per share), an increase of $553,989 (22.11%) from the previous fiscal year. Such
increase was primarily attributable to an increase in other income in fiscal
2000 as compared to fiscal 1999. Other income increased substantially due to
gains on the sale of other real estate of $421,367 in fiscal 2000. Other income
increased from $17,580 in fiscal 1999 to $429,137 in fiscal 2000. A substantial
portion of this gain resulted from the payoff of an interim loan associated with
an assisted living center in Sedona, Arizona which was foreclosed by the Trust
in fiscal 1999 and then sold. However, upon the sale of such property, the Trust
financed such purchase by the acceptance of the purchaser&#146;s interim
promissory note payable to the Trust. Therefore, the recognition of gain from
such sale was deferred until the note was paid to the Trust. Such note was paid
in full in fiscal 2000, therefore, resulting in the recognition of such gain. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Dividends related to fiscal 2000 were $3,010,346 or $.43 per
share. Dividends are based on taxable income which varies from net income
reported in the financial statements because of temporary differences
(differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported
amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible
amounts in future years). Future dividends may be more or less than net income
reported in the financial statements because of variances in these temporary
differences. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>During fiscal 2000, the prime interest rate increased from 7.75%
to 9.00%. Should the prime interest rate decrease during fiscal 2001, the
interest expense of the Trust will generally decrease and the net income of the
Trust will in turn generally increase. Should the prime interest rate increase
during fiscal 2001, the interest expense of the Trust will generally increase
and the net income of the Trust will in turn generally decrease. Because of the
recent increases in interest rates and the gains on the sale of other real
estate in fiscal 2000, the Trust expects that net income for 2001 will be
considerably less than fiscal 2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Payments received on the interim and permanent loan portfolio
and the church bonds held by the Trust decreased from $35,610,274 during fiscal
1999 to $26,342,866 during fiscal 2000, a decrease of 26.02%. This decrease was
primarily attributable to a decrease in interim loans made by the Trust during
the year ended March 31, 2000 and to an increase in non-performing mortgage
loans and interim construction loans. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>During fiscal 1998, the Trust foreclosed on three nonperforming
loans with total principal balances of approximately $1,360,000. As previously
mentioned, one loan constituted approximately $976,000 of the total and was
secured by an assisted living center located in Sedona, Arizona. The Trust sold
its interest in this property during fiscal 1999. However, the Trust financed
such purchase by the acceptance of the purchaser&#146;s interim promissory note
payable to </FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-9-</FONT></H1>


<PAGE>



the Trust.  Therefore, the gain from this sale was recognized by the Trust in fiscal 2000 when the
interim note was paid.

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Trust sold another property in fiscal 1999 located in
Colorado Springs, Colorado in exchange for part cash and the remainder of the
purchase price is paid pursuant to a note executed by the purchaser of such
property. Once again, the Trust will recognize the balance of the gain from the
sale of this property as the note is paid. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Also, the Trust sold in fiscal 1999 a portion of a piece of
property located in San Antonio, Texas which it had received in a foreclosure
conducted in fiscal 1998. In fiscal 2000, the Trust sold the balance of this
unimproved raw land. </FONT></P>

         During fiscal 2000, the Trust foreclosed on one non-performing loan in the amount of
$611,292.


<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Liquidity and Capital Resources</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Trust is engaged primarily in the business of making
permanent and interim loans to churches and other non-profit organizations, and
to other borrowers, including businesses engaged in the building and operation
of assisted living centers. At March 31, 2000, the Trust had seven loans to two
different borrowers which are secured by assisted living centers which totaled
approximately $12,483,000. Four of these loans were to affiliated borrowers
totaling approximately $9,272,133 and with the remaining three loans to another
borrower totaling $3,210,867. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The assets of the Trust primarily consist of its loan portfolio,
real estate acquired through foreclosure and its office building and facilities.
The operational expense of the Trust is comprised of the maintenance of its
office building, the payment of the salaries of its management and clerical
staff and the payment for legal and accounting services. Substantially all of
the Trust assets are invested in the permanent and interim loans made by the
Trust. The only potential liquidity problems of the Trust are related to the
timely and proper repayment by the Trust of the leveraged funds it has borrowed
to make loans in excess of its capital and the ability to fund loan commitments
which totaled $2,601,000 at March 31, 2000. All of the indebtedness of the Trust
is generally classified as short term having maturities ranging from &#147;on
demand&#148; to maturities repayable over various periods extending through
fiscal 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>All of the debt obligations of the Trust outstanding as of March
31, 2000 in the amount of $15,589,192 shall mature in fiscal 2001. These debt
obligations primarily consist of the Trust&#146;s bank line of credit, Master
Note Agreements and Secured Savings Certificates (&#147;Certificates&#148;)
which have been previously issued by the Trust. All of the Certificates
outstanding as of March 31, 2000 in the amount of $726,000 will mature during
the 2001 fiscal year. </FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-10-</FONT></H1>


<PAGE>



<P><FONT SIZE=3>At March 31, 2000, loans to the Trust under Master Note
Agreements, which are in effect demand notes, total $11,053,192. In the past,
the Trust has utilized its bank line of credit, principal paid to the Trust upon
its outstanding loan portfolio, and the proceeds received from the sale of
Certificates in order to meet its maturing obligations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>At March 31, 2000, the balance which could be borrowed by the
Trust upon its bank line of credit was $11,190,000. The principal payments
scheduled to be received by the Trust upon its loan portfolio for the years
ending March 31, 2001 and 2002 are $14,463,653 and $1,548,764, respectively.
Assuming all of these scheduled principal payments are received, these payments,
together with the balance available to Church Loans on its bank line of credit,
would allow Church Loans to have sufficient funds to meet its maturing
obligations and fund loan commitments without the necessity for Church Loans
having to sell any additional Certificates or borrow funds from other sources. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Due to the cost of registration and the other costs of sales of
Certificates, the cost of these funds are normally higher than the cost of
borrowing from bank sources or master notes. Therefore, the Trust discontinued
the registration of Certificates and ceased the sales of Certificates as of July
16, 1997. The Trust also obtained an increase in its bank line of credit from
$10,000,000 to $15,000,000 effective September 1, 1997. Based upon the success
of the Trust to obtain borrowings in the past, the Trust is confident that,
should it be necessary, it will be able to register and sell Certificates or
obtain additional bank financing in the future in sufficient amounts for the
Trust to timely meet all of its obligations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Should all the scheduled principal payments upon loans made by
the Trust not be received, and should the Trust be unable to borrow against its
line of credit, and should borrowings from other sources not be available it
would be necessary for the Trust to sell a portion of its mortgage loan
portfolio in order for it to meet all of its financial obligations. At March 31,
2000, the principal balance of the loan and church bond portfolio of the Trust
was $36,936,913. The weighted average interest rate on loans and church bonds
was 10.14% per annum. In view of the normal marketability of conventional loans,
the Trust would probably be required to discount the great majority of these
loans in order for them to be attractive for purchase. The principal amount of
these loans if discounted to yield a weighted average interest rate of 12%, 14%
and 16% would be $31,211,691, $26,752,878, and $23,408,769, respectively. There
is no assurance that the Trust would be able to sell all, or a portion of, its
portfolio of loans, in which event, it would be necessary for the Trust to
secure a loan, or loans, from a lender in order for the Trust to meet its
financial obligations. There is no assurance that the Trust would be able to
secure a loan in such instance. The Trust has sold only one of the loans in its
mortgage loan portfolio and, therefore, has limited experience in this area. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Principal payments scheduled to be received by the Trust upon
its permanent loan portfolio during the years ending March 31, 2001 and 2002, if
not used to fund new loan commitments, would be used to reduce the outstanding
indebtedness of the Trust. Should the Trust use the payments of principal which
shall be received upon its loan portfolio to reduce its outstanding </FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-11-</FONT></H1>


<PAGE>



<P><FONT SIZE=3>indebtedness, the interest expense of the Trust will decrease.
In such instance, whether the decrease in the interest income will exceed, or be
less than, the decrease in the interest expense will largely be dependent upon
the prime rate of interest prevailing at such time due to the fact that the
interest to be earned by the Trust upon its mortgage loan portfolio is generally
based upon a fixed rate of interest or a variable rate of interest that
periodically reprices, while the interest to be paid by the Trust upon its
outstanding debts is directly, or indirectly, tied to the prime rate of interest
charged by major domestic banks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>As of March 31, 2000, a substantial portion of the promissory
notes evidencing the loans made by the Trust have been pledged to secure its
outstanding indebtedness. At March 31, 2000 promissory notes in the principal
amount of $701,346 had been pledged to secure Certificates which had been
previously sold by the Trust. The required collateral for these Certificates
(based on the ratio of 1-to-1 for Certificates in Series O) was $726,000,
leaving a deficiency of promissory notes which have been pledged by the Trust to
secure said Certificates of $24,654 . (This deficiency was corrected subsequent
to the year end). Additionally, promissory notes totaling $10,416,156 were
pledged against the bank line of credit which had a total outstanding balance of
$3,810,000. The required collateral for this bank loan was $4,191,000, leaving
an excess of promissory notes which have been pledged to secure said bank notes
of $6,225,156. These excess promissory notes may be reassigned by the Indenture
Trustee or bank to the Trust to be sold in order for the Trust to meet its
financial obligations. Should it be necessary in order for the Trust to meet its
financial obligations, these excess notes amounting to $6,200,502 and other
additional promissory notes in the approximate amount of $25,819,411 (for a
total amount of $32,019,913) would be available to be sold by the Trust to meet
its financial obligations. Should the excess promissory notes be assigned by the
Indenture Trustee or bank to the Trust as heretofore described, all outstanding
Certificates sold by the Trust and the bank line of credit would continue to be
secured by the required ratio of notes pledged to the principal balance of these
Certificates and the bank line of credit. There is no assurance that the Trust
would be able to sell all, or any portion of these notes. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Cash flows from operating activities consists primarily of net
income. The primary components of net income are interest income and expense.
Interest income should continue to be the main source of cash provided by
operating activities; however, the availability of this cash flow is dependent
upon the ability of the borrowers to repay loans. Although there was an increase
in the amount of non-performing loans as of March 31, 2000 compared to March 31,
1999, management does not expect material changes in such loans in the near
term. Accordingly, cash provided by operating activities has been and is
expected to be a relatively stable source of cash flow. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Cash flows from investing activities results primarily from
investment in and payments received on mortgage and interim construction loans
and church bonds. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Cash flows from financing activities relate primarily to the
payments on Certificates and borrowings and payments on notes payable and the
line of credit. Borrowings are made as funds </FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-12-</FONT></H1>


<PAGE>



<P><FONT SIZE=3>are needed to make loans or as current obligations become due.
Based upon the success of the Trust to obtain borrowings in the past, the Trust
is confident that it will be able to obtain borrowings in the future in
sufficient amounts, along with payments to be received on loans, to timely meet
its obligations. Furthermore, the Trust is confident that if it decides to
register additional Certificates in the future it would have similar success in
selling the Certificates as it has had in the past. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Inflation</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>At March 31, 2000, the weighted average interest rate on the
mortgage loan and church bond portfolio of the Trust was 10.14% per annum while
the weighted average interest rate upon all borrowings of the Trust was 8.00%
per annum. Although a majority of the loans constituting the loan portfolio of
the Trust have been made at variable rates of interest that generally reprice
either daily, annually, or otherwise periodically, a portion of the loans
constituting the Trust&#146;s loan portfolio have been made at fixed rates of
interest and, therefore, are not subject to being increased or decreased during
the term of the loan. All of the indebtedness of the Trust, other than the
existing Certificates, is either directly or indirectly tied to the prime rate
of interest charged by major banking institutions and, therefore, is subject to
fluctuation. During periods of inflation, the prime rate of interest charged by
major banking institutions, as well as the interest rate or cost of borrowing
money from any lender, generally increases. Consequently, during an inflationary
period the interest expense of the Trust would increase. Since the interest
income of the Trust would not increase as rapidly, an increase in the interest
expense of the Trust would decrease the net income of the Trust. However,
interest income should subsequently increase as variable rate loans reprice.
Should the amount of the loans and the amount of the indebtedness of the Trust
remain constant, and should the weighted average interest rate upon the
indebtedness increase to approximately 24.03% per annum, the interest income and
the interest expense of the Trust would be substantially equal. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Odd-Lot Tender Offer</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>During fiscal 1999, the Trust completed an odd-lot tender offer.
Effective September 1, 1998, the Trust extended a tender offer to all
shareholders owning less than 100 shares of beneficial interest to purchase such
shares for $2.50 per share. The offer expired November 30, 1998. A total of
6,596 shares were purchased as a result of such odd-lot tender offer, thereby
reducing the number of outstanding shares of beneficial interest in the Trust to
7,000,806. No shares of the Trust were purchased by the Trust during fiscal
2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Church Loans
&amp; Investments Trust (a real estate investment trust) as of March 31, 2000
and 1999, and the related statements of income, shareholders&#146; equity, and
cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Church Loans
&amp; Investments Trust as of March&#160;31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. </FONT></P>

(A Real Estate Investment Trust)<br>
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies<br>
March 31, 2000 and 1999</H4>

<H4>NATURE OF OPERATIONS</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Church Loans &amp; Investments Trust (Church Loans) is a real
estate investment trust that invests primarily in mortgage and interim
construction loans to churches and other borrowers (see note 1) across the
United States, particularly in the southern portion of the U.S. Church Loans
requires that real estate properties be pledged against loans as security which
could be foreclosed by Church Loans should the borrower default. Repayment of
each borrower&#146;s obligations is generally expected to be repaid from
contributions from church members or from operations of the borrower, or in the
case of interim construction loans, by permanent financing provided by others. </FONT></P>

<H4>USE OF ESTIMATES</H4>


<P><FONT SIZE=3>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. </FONT></P>

<H4>CURRENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT</H4>


<P><FONT SIZE=3>Church Loans has historically invested in long-term, fixed-rate
mortgage loans, generally funded by relatively short-term debt obligations and
secured savings certificates (SSCs). The volatility of interest rates and
increased competition to attract customers&#146; funds have caused Church
Loans&#146; liability structure to become short-term and rate sensitive. Church
Loans reflected an average interest yield on its loan and church bond portfolio,
an average interest rate on its total indebtedness and a net interest rate
margin at March 31, 2000 and 1999 as follows: </FONT></P>

March 31, 1999                    10.06%                  6.90%                    3.16%

</PRE>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>Church Loans finances maturities of SSCs and debt obligations
through its available lines of credit and principal payments received on its
mortgage and interim construction loans. </FONT></P>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>CHURCH BONDS</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Church bonds, secured by first mortgage liens on church
facilities, are stated at cost, as there is no traded market for the bonds and
management intends to hold such securities until maturity. </FONT></P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CHURCH LOANS &amp; INVESTMENTS TRUST<br>
(A Real Estate Investment Trust)<br>
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies<br>
March 31, 2000 and 1999</H4>

<H4>LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR POSSIBLE CREDIT LOSSES</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, reduced by
unamortized purchase discounts and the allowance for possible credit losses.
Interest income is recognized when earned. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#146;s effective interest rate
or the market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is
collateral dependent. The accrual of interest is generally discontinued on
mortgage loans and church bonds more than 90 days past due (180 days for interim
construction loans) or when there is sufficient doubt as to the collection of
interest. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is
reversed. Cash interest payments received are applied to principal when
collection of principal is in doubt or are recognized as interest income when
recovery of principal is reasonably assured. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The allowance for possible credit losses is established through
a provision for possible credit losses charged to expense. Loans and church
bonds are charged against the allowance when collectibility of the principal is
unlikely. Recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the
allowance. The charge to operations is based on management&#146;s and the board
of trust managers&#146; evaluation of the loan and church bond portfolio,
including such factors as the security collateralizing the loans or church
bonds, past credit loss experience and general economic conditions. The
allowance is subjective in nature and may be adjusted in the near term because
of changes in the borrower&#146;s financial status or economic conditions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Commitment fees received on interim construction loans are
recognized over the interim commitment period for loans that are not permanently
financed by Church Loans and over the life of the mortgage loan for loans that
are permanently financed by Church Loans. Amounts are being amortized using the
straight-line method. This method was not materially different from the method
of deferring commitment fees until the commitment is exercised and recognizing
such fees as an adjustment to yield by the interest method over the related
loans&#146; lives as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles for
the years ended March&#160;31, 2000 and 1999. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Purchase discounts on loans are amortized based on the interest method.</FONT></P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT</H4>


<P><FONT SIZE=3>Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. </FONT></P>

<H4>REAL ESTATE ACQUIRED THROUGH FORECLOSURE</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Real estate acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure is
to be sold and is initially recorded at estimated fair value at date of
foreclosure establishing a new cost basis. Other real estate owned, after
foreclosure, is carried at the lower of carrying amount or the property&#146;s
estimated fair value minus estimated costs to sell (fair value). Declines in the
estimated fair value below cost are recognized as a valuation allowance. If the
estimated fair value subsequently increases above its carrying value, the
valuation allowance is reduced, but not below zero. Increases or decreases in
the valuation allowance are charged or credited to operations. </FONT></P>

Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the asset and liability method of Statement
109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under Statement 109, the
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Mortgage loans receivable consist of conventional loans of
$23,504,519 and $25,129,877 and church bonds of $389,511 and $401,172 at

loans are generally secured by first liens on real estate comprised primarily of
church buildings and other real estate. The amount of a loan is generally
limited to 66-2/3% of the appraised value of the related property. Certain loans
are guaranteed by individual members of the congregations or other individuals
or congregations, depending on the circumstances. </FONT></P>

bonds and interim construction loans with interest rates ranging from 8% to 17%
at March 31, 2000. The weighted average annual interest rates of Church
Loans&#146; loan and church bond portfolio were 10.14% and 10.06% at
March&#160;31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Generally accepted accounting principles require disclosure of

loans to churches, Church Loans makes certain interim real estate construction
loans and permanent loans to entities other than churches. At March 31, 2000,
Church Loans had seven loans to two borrowers which were secured by assisted

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>NOTE 2 - DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CONTINUED)</H4>


<P><FONT SIZE=3>Descriptions of the various categories of debt obligations follow:</FONT><P>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Secured Savings Certificates</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>SSCs were issued in amounts of $1,000 or more and have single
maturity dates from 30 days to 10 years from date of issue. With respect to an
individual certificate, interest rate and frequency of payment of interest
(either monthly, quarterly, semiannually, annually or at maturity) are fixed at
the time of issuance of the certificate. Effective July 1997, Church Loans
discontinued the sale of SSCs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The certificates are secured under the terms of certain
indentures that require, among other things, the pledge of mortgage notes
receivable with total unpaid principal amounts not less than 100% of the
aggregate principal amount of certain respective SSC registrations outstanding.
At March&#160;31, 1999, Church Loans was in compliance with the requirement. As
of March 31, 2000, Church Loans was not in compliance with this requirement.
Subsequent to year end, Church Loans pledged additional mortgage notes
receivables in order to meet the collateral obligation. </FONT></P>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Line of Credit Payable to Bank</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The line of credit payable to bank consists of borrowings under
a loan agreement effective through December&#160;30, 2000, that provides for a
$15,000,000 line of credit with certain commitment fees. The loan agreement
requires Church Loans to pledge mortgage loans receivable having unpaid
principal balances with an aggregate present value, discounted at 2% over the
prime rate (11% at March&#160;31, 2000), of not less than 110% of all
indebtedness owed to the bank. Interest accrued at the prime rate less one
percent during 2000 and 1999. Interest is payable semiannually. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Additionally, the line of credit requires that Church

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS</H4>


<P><FONT SIZE=3>Church Loans is a party to financial instruments with
off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business. Commitments to extend
credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of
any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have variable
interest rates, fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and require
payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments may expire without being drawn
upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements. Church Loans evaluates each customer&#146;s credit worthiness on a
case-by-case basis. Collateral generally includes real estate properties. The
exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the
commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount. At March
31, 2000, Church Loans had outstanding loan commitments (by contract amounts) of
approximately $2,601,000. Management does not anticipate any losses as a result
of these transactions. </FONT></P>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>NOTE 9 - DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</H4>


<P><FONT SIZE=3>The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
fair value of each class of financial instruments, the results of applying such
methods and assumptions to the financial instruments and limitations inherent in
fair value estimates: </FONT></P>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Cash and Cash Equivalents</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The assets are considered short-term instruments for which the
carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. </FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-31-</FONT></H1>


<PAGE>


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>NOTE 9 - DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)</H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Loans and Church Bonds</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial
characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, such as mortgage and interim
construction loans and church bonds. Each loan category is further segmented
into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms. For variable-rate loans,
primarily interim construction loans, that reprice frequently and with no
significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying amounts.
The fair value of fixed-rate mortgage loans and bonds is generally estimated by
discounting the future cash flows through the estimated maturity using the
current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar
credit ratings. The estimate of maturity is based on Church Loans&#146;
historical experience with repayments for each loan classification, modified, as
required, by an estimate of the effect of current economic and lending
conditions. The carrying value of loans, net of the allowance for loan losses
was $35,548,741 and $35,855,928 and the fair value of loans was approximately
$34,800,000 and $36,800,000 at March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. </FONT></P>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Notes Payable and Line of Credit</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The fair value of notes payable and the line of credit are equal
to the carrying value as such liabilities are deemed to be short-term
borrowings. </FONT></P>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Secured Savings Certificates</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The fair value of secured savings certificates is estimated
using the rates currently offered for financial instruments of similar
characteristics. The carrying value of secured savings certificates was $726,000
and $2,763,376 and the fair value of secured savings certificates was
approximately $729,000 and $2,811,000 at March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. </FONT></P>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Commitments to Extend Credit</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Generally, Church Loans enters into commitments to extend credit
at adjustable interest terms. Accordingly, the commitment amount is a reasonable
estimate of fair value. </FONT></P>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Limitations</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based
on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.
These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from
offering for sale at one time Church Loans&#146; entire holdings of a particular
financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of
Church Loans&#146; financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on
judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic
conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other
factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and
matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with
precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. </FONT></P>
