<pre>ITEM 1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</STRONG>

	<STRIKE></STRIKE>Cardiff Communications, Inc.,  (&quot;the Company&quot;) was organized in December 1906 in the State
of Utah under the name Cardiff Mining &amp; Milling Company.  During the 60's the Company changed its name
to Cardiff Industries, Inc. and sold its mining operations.  During the next decade the Company focused its
operations on the television and radio industry.  Subsequently, the name was changed to Cardiff
Communications in 1980.   Subsequent to the period encompassed in this filing, the Company changed it's
domicile to the state of Nevada.  The Company has had no operations in the last 10 years.

	The board of directors feel that the Company does not meet the criteria of a development stage
company (as defined in SFAS 7 &quot;<EM>Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises</EM>&quot;) primarily
because it is not currently producing or marketing a product or service. However, the Company is currently
seeking a business opportunity to merge with or acquire, but to date has not located any such business
opportunities.

	In seeking a business opportunity to merge with or acquire, management is reviewing various
business plans. Management has not limited their review of plans or exploration of acquisitions to any
particular industry or service sector. Though there appears to be a large number of companies seeking to
merge with an existing public company, the management has not yet identified a business to complete such
a transaction with and the Company has not entered into any binding agreements for an acquisition or
merger. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in finding any business opportunity to
merge with or acquire.
<STRIKE>
</STRIKE>
<STRONG>ITEM 2.  DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY</STRONG>

	The Company currently maintains its corporate presence from the office of the Company's
legal counsel and pays no rent or expenses.

<pre>ITEM 5.  MARKET PRICE FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS</STRONG>
</pre>
<PRE>
	The Company is not currently trading in any public markets and has not been able to obtain any
reliable trading history for the period reported.   As of September 30, 2000, the Company had approximately
1218  shareholders of record.

	The Company has not declared any cash dividends on its Common Stock in the last thirty years<STRIKE></STRIKE>
and its Board of Directors has no present intention of declaring any dividends.  For the foreseeable future,
the Company intends to retain all earnings, if any, for use in the development and expansion of its business.

</PRE>
<PRE>
<STRONG>ITEM 6.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
         AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</STRONG></PRE>
<PRE>
Financial Condition

	The Company had revenue of $3800 during the year ended September 30, 2000.  Total
stockholders' deficit was $(64,566), as compared to a stockholders  equity of $10,634 at September 30, 1999.
The Company has  no operating capital for future operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

	The Company has no liquid assets and is currently in the process of looking for business
opportunities to merge with or acquire.  At minimum, the Company will need to raise additional capital
through private funding to meet the financial needs of being a reporting company.  Historically, the
Company has been successful in raising operational capital.  There is no guarantee that the Company
will be successful in obtaining necessary funding to develop any business opportunities.

Results of Operations

	 The Company reported a net income of $800 for the year ended September 30, 2000, compared
to a  loss of $(2,300) for the previous year.  The Company anticipates very little or no overhead from future
operations until a successor business can be acquired or merged.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT</PRE>

<PRE>

Stockholders and Directors
Cardiff Communications, Inc.
Salt Lake City, Utah


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Cardiff Communications, Inc. as of
September 30, 2000 and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the
years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express and opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
</PRE>
<PRE>	We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Cardiff Communications, Inc. at September 30, 2000, and the results of its
operations and cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.</PRE>
<PRE>
	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will
continue as a going concern.  As discussed in Note 5, the Company's recurring operating losses and lack of
working capital raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  Management's plans
in regard to those matters are also described in Note 5.  The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</PRE>

<PRE>NOTE 2INCOME TAXES

	The Company adopted Statement of Financial Standards No. 109 &quot;Accounting for Income  taxes&quot;

year accordingly, no deferred tax liabilities have been recognized.</PRE>
<PRE>
	No provision for income taxes has been recorded due to net operating loss carryforward  totaling

NOTE 3 USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported  amounts of assets
and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  In these  financial statements, assets, liabilities and
earnings involve extensive reliance on  management's estimates.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

NOTE 4  COMMON STOCK TRANSACTIONS

	In 1999, the Company issued 1,900,000 shares of common stock at $.04, for a note receivable
of $76,000.  The note bears interest at 5% and is payable on demand.

NOTE 5  NOTE PAYABLE

	The company has issued an unsecured note payable in the amount of $60,000 bearing interest
at 5% per year.  Principle and interest of the note is due and payable on demand.  The note  payable is
convertible into common stock at 75% of market value or par value, whichever is greater.

NOTE 6  GOING CONCERN

	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will
continue as a going concern.  The company has had recurring operating losses for the past  several years and
is dependent upon financing to continue operations.  The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of uncertainty.

	It is management's plan to find an operating company to merge with, thus creating necessary
operating revenue.


We hereby consent to the use of our audit report of Cardiff Communications, Inc. dated for the year ended
