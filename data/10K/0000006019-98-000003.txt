                             Part I


Item 1. Description of
Business

(a) Business Development

Breccia International Minerals Inc.("Registrant") was incorporated under the
laws of the State of Delaware on April 25, 1975.  The  Registrant's principal
offices are located  at  #1500 Midland Walwyn Tower, Edmonton, Alberta,
Canada,  T5J  2Z2, and it's  registered  office is 1209 Orange Street,
Wilmington,  New Castle, Delaware, 19801. The telephone number is
(403) 496-9171. 

On  March  18,  1994, the Registrant received  a Certificate  of Renewal from
the State of Delaware.

The Registrant held an annual meeting on February 14, 1997 and approved a 
reverse stock split and redesignation of share capital. The Registrant
consolidated the issued and outstanding $0.01 par value common stock on basis
of one (1) $0.0001 par value stock for each twenty (20) $0.01 par value 
common stock. The Registrant also redesignated the share capital to $0.0001 
par value common stock and changed its name to Breccia International Minerals
Inc.

The   Registrant  has  not  been  involved  in  any bankruptcy, receivership 
or similar proceedings.

(b) Business of Issuer

In 1997/98, the Registrant entered into a Letter of Intent with a Canadian 
corporate finance consulting firm to undertake a stock acquisition and plan 
of reorganization resulting in the Registrant entering into the business of 
management and reverse merger buyouts.  In early 1998, following extensive 
negotiations, a final agreement could not be reached and the transaction did 
not close.

The Registrant continues to pursue viable avenues of growth in order to 
maximize shareholder value and is optimistic for its prospects in 1998/99.

The Registrant owns no patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, or 
concessions.

The  Registrant  has  no  portion of its business which  may  be subject  to 
re-negotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the
election of the Government.

The Registrant has not conducted any research and development and no future
research is proposed at this time.

The  Registrant  has  not made any material capital expenditures which 
require environmental control facilities.

The Registrant currently has no full-time employees.

Item 2. Description of Property

The  Registrant currently has no operations or interests in any properties 
directly or throught ownership of partnership interests at April 30, 1998.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

The Registrant knows of no pending or threatened material legal proceedings 
to which the Registrant is a party of, and no such proceedings  are  known to
the Registrant to be  contemplated  by governmental authorities.

Item 4. Submission of matters to a vote of security holders.

No matter was submitted during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered 
by this report to a vote of security holders, through the solicitation of 
proxies or otherwise.


                       Part II

Item 5. Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters

The  Registrant's common stock is currently trading on the OTC Bulletin Board
under the symbol "BIMI"

                                        Number of

$0.0001 Par Value                          1,890
Common Stock

Since the Registrant was quoted on the OTC Bulletin board on October 16,
1996 the low bid was $0.01 and the high bid was $6.00 with the most recent
close at $4.20.  These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail
mark-ups, mark-downs or commission and may not represent actual transactions.
The source of the high and low bid information is provided by the Registrant's
market maker.

No  dividends have ever been declared or paid with respect to the Registrant's
common stock.  The Registrant has no present  plans to pay dividends in the 
foreseeable future.

Item 6. Management Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation

a) Plan of Operations

Due to uncontrollable market conditions in the mineral exploration sector,
the Registrant has shifted its focus away from mining and is exploring
other business opportunities.

In late 1997, the Registrant entered into a Letter of Intent with a Canadian 
corporate finance consulting firm to undertake a stock acquisition and plan 
of reorganization leading to the Registrant entering into the business of 
management and reverse merger buyouts.  In early 1998, following extensive 
negotiations, a final agreement could not be reached and the transaction did 
not close.

The Registrant continues to pursue viable avenues of growth in order to
maximize shareholder value and is optimistic for its prospects in fiscal
1998/99.

b) Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.

The results of the statement of loss for the fiscal year ended April 30, 1998
indicates a loss of $31,747 which represents transfer agent, legal and
consulting fees necessary to maintain the Registrant current with its
regulatory filing requirements.

The results of the statement of loss for the fiscal year ended April 30, 1997
indicates a loss of $304,131.

Auditors' Report





To the Shareholders of
Breccia International Minerals Inc.


We have audited the balance sheets of Breccia International Minerals Inc. 
as at April 30, 1998 and 1997 and the statements of operations and deficit 
and changes in financial position for the years then ended. These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the company's management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based 
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation.

In our opinion, these financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of the company as at April 30,1998 and 1997 
and the results of its operations and the changes in its financial position 
for the years then ended in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles.

                  Minerals Inc. Summary of
                  Significant Accounting Policies
                  
April 30, 1998 and 1997

Nature of Business

Breccia International Minerals Inc. (formerly American Energy & Technology 
Inc.) (the Company) is a public company incorporated on April 25, 1975 under 
the laws of the State of Delaware, USA and renewed on March 18, 1994.
                 
To April 30, 1998, the company has been involved in the process of
identifying and evaluating prospective business entities with a view
to the acquisition of a controlling or minority interest therein. Costs
related to these investigations are expensed as incurred.  The successful
acquisition of the investment will also be dependent upon the company's
ability to obtain necessary financing at that time.

Basis of Presentation

These financial statements have been prepared according to Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles.  However, as the U.S. dollar
is the principal currency in which the corporation's business is conducted,
these financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars.

Financial Instruments

The company as a part of its operations carries a number of financial
instruments.  Unless otherwise noted, it is management's opinion that the 
Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks
arising from these financial instruments.

The fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying
values, unless otherwise noted.
