<P>  Church  Loans  &amp;  Investments  Trust  ("the  Trust")  is a real  estate
investment  trust  organized under the laws of the State of Texas in March 1963.
Although  the Trust has the  authority  to engage  in the  business  of  buying,
selling and leasing of real  estate,  the Trust has  heretofore  restricted  its
business  activities  primarily to making loans to churches and other  nonprofit
organizations  and assisted living centers which are secured by a first mortgage
on real estate owned by such borrowers.</P>

<P>The period of duration of the Trust, unless dissolved in accordance with law,
or by the consent of the owners of shares of  beneficial  interest in the Trust,
is  perpetual.  The Trust may be dissolved by the  affirmative  vote of not less
than two-thirds of the owners of outstanding shares of the Trust.</P>

<P>The control and management of the Trust properties,  and all powers necessary
or  appropriate  to effect  any and all of the  purposes  for which the Trust is
organized, is vested in the Board of Trust Managers.</P>

<P>The number of shares of  beneficial  interest in the Trust which the Trust is
authorized to issue is unlimited.</P>

<P>The Trust is qualified as a "real  estate  investment  trust" under  Sections
856-858 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the "Internal  Revenue
Code" or "Code").  It is the  intention of the Trust to continue to qualify as a
real estate investment trust under the Code.</P>

<P>The Trust maintains an office located at 5305 I-40 West,  Amarillo,  TX 79106
(telephone 806/358-3666).</P>

<P>As mentioned above, the Trust is primarily  engaged in the business of making
mortgage loans to churches and other nonprofit organizations and assisted living
centers.  The  Declaration  of Trust  restricts the  investments of the Trust to
loans  secured by a first  mortgage,  deed of trust or other lien  covering real
property with the amount of such loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of the value of the
real  property  securing  such loan as  determined  by a  competent  independent
appraiser.  Although  the Trust has been  primarily  in the  business  of making
long-term  mortgage  loans,  during  the past  several  years  it has also  been
actively involved in making short-term  interim or construction loans to finance
the  construction  of church  buildings,  the  construction  of assisted  living
centers,   the  purchase  of  real  estate,   or  the  refinancing  of  existing
indebtedness.  Most of the interim loans  presently

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-4-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<P>being made by the Trust are  associated  with bond  offerings of churches and
other nonprofit  organizations and assisted living centers.  These interim loans
are scheduled to be repaid from the proceeds of the bond offerings.</P>

<P>The Trust is not limited to the  location of the property  securing any loans
in which it may  invest  and seeks to  spread  its  investments  in areas of the
United States where favorable yields prevail.</P>

<P>As of March 31, 2002,  the Trust has 96 permanent and interim  mortgage loans
and investments in church bonds having a principal balance of $47,152,630,  with
the average principal amount thereof</P>

<P>being  $491,173.  The  interest  rates on these loans vary from 5% to 13% per
annum with the weighted average interest rate of mortgage loans and church bonds
being 9.14% per annum at March 31, 2002.</P>

<P>The  original  terms of these loans vary from one year to thirty years,  with
the majority being for a term of twenty years.</P>

<P>During the fiscal year of the Trust ending March 31, 2002,  the net income of
the Trust was $3,281,795,  as compared to $2,628,232 in fiscal 2001, an increase
of 24.87%.  Such  increase  in net income of the Trust was due to an increase in
the Trust's net interest income.  Net interest income of the Trust was higher in
fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 due to several  reasons,  including:  (a)
the  payment  of  several  loans  owing  to  the  Trust  that  were   previously
characterized as  non-performing,  and (b) a decrease in interest expense of the
Trust.</P>

<P>The net income of the Trust for each of the quarters  during  fiscal 2002 was
as  follows:   first  quarter-  $1,022,375;   second   quarter-$841,286;   third
quarter-$763,890; and fourth quarter-$654,244.</P>

<P>The  operational  expense of the Trust  increased from $731,524 during fiscal
2001 to $785,512 in fiscal 2002. The  operational  expense of the Trust included
general and administrative  expenses and compensation to members of the Board of
Trust Managers.</P>

<P>During  fiscal 2002,  the Trust  advanced loan proceeds of  $32,691,886 on 29
interim  loans and 6  permanent  loans.  Most,  if not all,  of such  loans bear
interest at a variable  rate  varying from 1.5% to 2% per annum in excess of the
prime rate of interest  published  by the Wall  Street  Journal and known as the
"Wall Street Journal Prime."</P>

<P>During  fiscal 2002,  the Trust employed a total of 5 full time employees and
employed, as needed, three additional part-time employees.</P>

<P> The  business  conditions  in which  the  Trust  operates  has  become  more
competitive in the past fiscal year as more and more banks are  re-entering  the
business of making loans to churches, especially the more desirable, less risky,
church loans.  If this trend  continues,  the rates and fees which the trust can
charge may  decrease.  However,  loan demand  remains

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-5-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<P>good as  evidenced by the number of loan  requests  received by the Trust and
the number of loan commitments outstanding as of March 31, 2002.</P>

<A NAME="DESCRIPTION_OF_PROPERTY"></A>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Item 2 - DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY</FONT></H2>

<P>The Trust maintains as its only place of business its offices located at 5305
I-40  West,  in  Amarillo,  Texas.  Such  building  is owned by the Trust and is
occupied  solely by the  Trust.  There is no debt owed by Trust in regard to its
real property.</P>

<P> The real  properties of the Trust,  net of  depreciation  and excluding real
estate  acquired  through  foreclosure,  are not a  significant  portion  of the
Trust's assets, representing less than 1% of the Trust's total assets.</P>

<P>As  previously  mentioned,  the  Trust's  primary  business  is the making of
mortgage loans to churches and other nonprofit organizations and assisted living
centers.  The  Declaration  of Trust  restricts the  investments of the Trust to
loans secured by a first  mortgage,  deed of trust,  or other lien covering real
property with the amount of such loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of the value of the
real property  securing such loan.  The  Declaration of Trust may not be amended
without the  affirmative  vote of two- thirds  (2/3rds) of the  Certificates  of
Beneficial  Interest  entitled  to vote.  The Board of Trust  Managers'  general
policy is to limit  investment  of Trust assets in any one mortgage  loan to not
more than $2,000,000. However, at the discretion of the Board of Trust Managers,
the  Trust  may make  and has  made  loans in  excess  of such  limit.  All such
investment  in  mortgage  loans is for the  purpose  of  earning  income for the
Trust.</P>

<P><B>Results of Operations 2002 compared to 2001</B></P>

<P>During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002,  interest income and fees of the
Trust increased by $377,563 (7.68%) over the previous fiscal year. Such increase
was primarily  attributable to an increase in performing  mortgage loans, church
bonds and interim loans and an increase in net interest rate margin.</P>

<P>The  average  interest  rate on loans  and  church  bonds  held by the  Trust
decreased from 10.28% as of March 31, 2001 to 9.14% as of March 31, 2002.</P>

<P>There was an increase in the amount of  performing  interim loans held by the
Trust from  $11,537,684 as of March 31, 2001 to $15,317,011 as of March 31, 2002
and there was an increase in performing  mortgage  loans and church bonds during
the recent fiscal year from  $25,537,346  as of March 31, 2001 to $30,507,636 as
of March 31, 2002. In addition,  non-performing  loans decreased from $5,655,875
as of March 31, 2001 to  $1,151,907 as of March 31, 2002.  Therefore,  the total
performing and non- performing  mortgage  loans,  church bonds and interim loans
held by the Trust increased from $42,730,905 as of March 31, 2001 to $46,976,554
as of March 31, 2002.  This  increase is partially  the result of an increase in
the  investment  in mortgage and interim  loans made by the Trust during  fiscal
2002 of  $32,691,886  as  compared  to  $30,618,186  during  fiscal  2001.  This
represents an increase of $2,073,700 or 6.77%. The increase in the investment by
the Trust in  mortgage  loans  also  contributed  to an  increase  of $98,318 in
commitment  fees earned by the Trust in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal  2001.
The increase in performing  mortgage  loans,  church bonds and interim loans was
offset  by an</p>

<P>increase in the payments received on mortgage and interim  construction loans
and church  bonds from  $24,886,228  for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001 to
$27,454,632 during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002.</P>

<P> The net income of the Trust for fiscal 2002 was $3,281,795 ($.47 per share),
an increase of $653,563  (24.87%) from the previous  fiscal year.  Such increase
was primarily  attributable  to an increase in the Trust's net interest  income.
Net interest  income  increased from  $3,344,074 in fiscal 2001 to $4,302,595 in
fiscal 2002, an increase of $958,521 (28.66%) from fiscal 2001.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-8-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<P>The interest income of the Trust for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002 was
significantly influenced by the payment of several loans owing to the Trust that
were previously  characterized  as non-  performing.  The pay-off of these loans
resulted  in an  additional  recognition  of  interest  income of  approximately
$586,000 in fiscal 2002.</P>

<P>The  increase  in the net  income  of the  Trust  for  fiscal  2002  was also
attributable to a decrease in the interest expense of the Trust. In fiscal 2002,
the average aggregate amount of total debt outstanding was $270,756 more than in
fiscal 2001.  However,  the weighted  average interest rate decreased from 8.33%
for the year ended March 31,  2001 to 5.12% for the year ended  March 31,  2002.
The interest  expense of the Trust decreased from $1,568,994 for the fiscal year
ended  March 31, 2001 to $989,219  for the fiscal year ended March 31,  2002,  a
decrease  of  $579,775  or  36.95%.   The  average   month-end  balance  of  the
indebtedness  owing by the Trust increased from  $18,854,370 for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2001 to  $19,125,126  for the fiscal year ended March 31,  2002.
Such increase was due to an increase in the debt of the Trust resulting from the
increase in the Trust's investment in mortgages and interim loans. The effect on
interest  expense of increased debt was offset by a decrease in the Trust's cost
of funds as previously mentioned.</P>

<P>Income from the  realization of loan discounts from loan purchases  increased
from  $42,033 for the year ended  March 31, 2001 to $264,694  for the year ended
March 31, 2002, an increase of $222,661.</P>

<P>General and administrative  expenses of the Trust increased from $676,149 for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001 to $733,957 for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2002, an increase of $57,808 or 8.55%.</P>

<P>Dividends related to fiscal 2002 were $3,360,387 or $.48 per share. Dividends
are based on  taxable  income  which  varies  from net  income  reported  in the
financial statements because of temporary  differences  (differences between the
tax basis of an asset or  liability  and its  reported  amount in the  financial
statements  that will result in taxable or deductible  amounts in future years).
Future  dividends  may be more or less  than  the  net  income  reported  in the
financial statements because of variances in these temporary differences.</P>

<P> During  fiscal 2002,  the prime  interest rate  decreased  from 8.00% at the
beginning  of the fiscal year to 4.75% at the close of the fiscal  year.  Should
the prime interest rate decrease during fiscal 2003, the interest expense of the
Trust will  generally  decrease  and the net income of the Trust will,  in turn,
generally increase.  Should the prime interest rate increase during fiscal 2003,
the interest expense of the Trust will generally  increase and the net income of
the Trust will, in turn, generally decrease.</P>

<P>Gain  on the  sale  of  properties  which  the  Trust  had  obtained  through
foreclosure  was  $180,662  for fiscal  2001 as compared to gain of the sales of
foreclosed properties in fiscal</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-9-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<P>2002 of $0. Therefore,  other income of the Trust decreased from $200,452 for
fiscal 2001 to $32,203 for fiscal 2002.</P>

<P><B>Liquidity and Capital Resources</B></P>

<P>The  Trust is engaged  primarily  in the  business  of making  permanent  and
interim  loans to  churches  and other  non-profit  organizations,  and to other
borrowers,  including  businesses  engaged  in the  building  and  operation  of
assisted  living  centers.  At March 31,  2002,  the Trust had five loans to two
different  borrowers  which are secured by assisted living centers which totaled
approximately  $8,042,000.  Three of these  loans were to  affiliated  borrowers
totaling  approximately  $1,672,000  and with the remaining two loans to another
borrower totaling approximately $6,370,000.</P>

<P>The assets of the Trust primarily consist of its loan portfolio,  real estate
acquired  through  foreclosure  and its  office  building  and  facilities.  The
operational  expense of the Trust is comprised of the  maintenance of its office
building,  the payment of the  salaries  of its  management  and support  staff,
office expenses,  fees paid to the Board of Trust Managers,  and the payment for
legal  and  accounting  services.  Substantially  all of the  Trust  assets  are
invested  in the  permanent  and  interim  loans  made by the  Trust.  The  only
potential  liquidity  problems of the Trust are related to the timely and proper
repayment by the Trust of the  leveraged  funds it has borrowed to make loans in
excess of its  capital and the ability to fund loan  commitments  which  totaled
approximately $9,959,000 at March 31, 2002. All of the indebtedness of the Trust
is generally classified as short term having maturities ranging from "on demand"
to maturities repayable over various periods extending through fiscal 2003.</P>

<P>All of the debt obligations of the Trust  outstanding as of March 31, 2002 in
the amount of  $25,854,555  will mature in fiscal 2003.  These debt  obligations
primarily consist of the Trust's bank line of credit and Master Note Agreements.
Although  the  Trust's  bank  line of  credit  matures  in  fiscal  2003,  it is
anticipated that the line of credit will be renewed annually.  In the event that
the bank  elects not to renew the line of credit,  the Trust may under the terms
of the loan  agreement  retire the line of credit over a period of time,  not to
exceed five years,  equal to the  weighted  average  remaining  term of all real
estate  lien  notes of the Trust  which are  pledged  to secure the bank line of
credit.</P>

<P>Previously,  the Trust issued Secured Savings Certificates  ("Certificates").
However,  effective July 1997 the Trust  discontinued  the sale of Certificates.
All  previously  issued  Certificates  were  paid in full  prior  to  March  31,
2001.</P>

<P>At March 31, 2002 loans to the Trust under Master Note Agreements,  which are
in effect demand notes, total  $15,194,555.  In the past, the Trust has utilized
its bank line of credit and the principal paid to the Trust upon its outstanding
loan portfolio, and the proceeds received from the sale of Certificates in order
to meet its maturing obligations.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-10-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<P> At March 31, 2002, the balance which could be borrowed by the Trust upon its
bank line of credit was  $4,340,000.  The  principal  payments  scheduled  to be
received by the Trust upon its loan  portfolio  for the years  ending  March 31,
2003 and 2004 are  $16,762,703  and  $1,596,543,  respectively.  Assuming all of
these scheduled principal payments are received,  these payments,  together with
the balance available to The Trust on its bank line of credit, would not provide
The Trust with sufficient funds to meet its</P>

<P>maturing  obligations and fund loan commitments  without the necessity of The
Trust either  selling  additional  Certificates  or  borrowing  funds from other
sources.</P>

<P>Due to the cost of registration and the other costs of sales of Certificates,
the cost of these funds are normally higher than the cost of borrowing from bank
sources or master notes.  Therefore,  the Trust discontinued the registration of
Certificates and ceased the sales of Certificates as of July 16, 1997. The Trust
also  obtained  an  increase  in its bank line of  credit  from  $10,000,000  to
$15,000,000  effective September 1, 1997. Based upon the success of the Trust to
obtain  borrowings  in the  past,  the  Trust is  confident  that,  should it be
necessary,  it  will be  able  to  register  and  sell  Certificates  or  obtain
additional  bank financing in the future in sufficient  amounts for the Trust to
timely meet all of its obligations.</P>

<P>Should all the scheduled  principal payments upon loans made by the Trust not
be  received,  and  should  the Trust be unable  to borrow  against  its line of
credit,  and should borrowings from other sources not be available,  it would be
necessary  for the Trust to sell a portion of its  mortgage  loan  portfolio  in
order for it to meet all of its financial  obligations.  At March 31, 2002,  the
principal  balance  of the loan and  church  bond  portfolio  of the  Trust  was
$46,976,554.  The weighted  average  interest rate on loans and church bonds was
9.14% per annum. In view of the normal  marketability of conventional loans, the
Trust  might be required to discount a majority of these loans in order for them
to be attractive for purchase. The principal amount of these loans if discounted
to  yield  a  weighted  average  interest  rate of 12%,  14%  and 16%  would  be
$35,780,475,  $30,668,979, and $26,835,356,  respectively. There is no assurance
that the Trust  would be able to sell all,  or a portion  of, its  portfolio  of
loans,  in which event, it would be necessary for the Trust to secure a loan, or
loans,  from a lender in order for the Trust to meet its financial  obligations.
There is no  assurance  that the  Trust  would be able to  secure a loan in such
instance.  The  Trust  has sold  only  one of the  loans  in its  mortgage  loan
portfolio and, therefore, has limited experience in this area.</P>

<P>Principal  payments  scheduled to be received by the Trust upon its permanent
loan  portfolio  during the years ending March 31, 2003 and 2004, if not used to
fund new loan commitments,  would be used to reduce the outstanding indebtedness
of the Trust.  Should the Trust use the  payments  of  principal  which shall be
received upon its loan  portfolio to reduce its  outstanding  indebtedness,  the
interest  expense of the Trust will  decrease.  In such  instance,  whether  the
decrease in the interest  income will exceed,  or be less than,  the decrease in
the interest  expense will largely be dependent  upon the prime rate of interest
prevailing  at such time due to the fact that the  interest  to be earned by the
Trust upon its mortgage  loan  portfolio  is  generally  based upon a fixed rate
of</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-11-</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<PAGE>

<P>interest or a variable rate of interest that periodically reprices, while the
interest  to be paid by the Trust upon its  outstanding  debts is  directly,  or
indirectly,  tied to the  prime  rate of  interest  charged  by  major  domestic
banks.</P>

<P>As  of  March  31,  2002,  a  substantial  portion  of the  promissory  notes
evidencing  the loans made by the Trust have been  pledged to secure the Trust's
bank line of credit.  Promissory notes totaling $12,617,124 were pledged against
the bank line of credit which had a total  outstanding  balance of  $10,660,000.
The required collateral for this bank loan was $11,726,000, leaving an excess of
promissory  notes which have been pledged to secure said bank notes of $891,124.
These excess  promissory  notes may be reassigned by the bank to the Trust to be
sold in order  for the  Trust to meet its  financial  obligations.  Should it be
necessary,  in order  for the  Trust to meet its  financial  obligations,  these
excess notes amounting to $891,124 and other additional  promissory notes in the
approximate  amount of $34,359,430 (for a total amount of $35,250,554)  would be
available to be sold by the Trust to meet its financial obligations.</P>

<P>Should  the excess  promissory  notes be assigned by the bank to the Trust as
heretofore  described,  the bank line of credit would  continue to be secured by
the required ratio of notes pledged to the principal balance of the bank line of
credit.  There is no assurance  that the Trust would be able to sell all, or any
portion of, these notes.</P>

<P>Cash flows from operating  activities  consists  primarily of net income. The
primary  components  of net income are  interest  income and  expense.  Interest
income  should  continue  to be the main source of cash  provided  by  operating
activities;  however,  the  availability of this cash flow is dependent upon the
ability of the  borrowers to repay loans.  In fact,  there was a decrease in the
amount of non-performing  loans as of March 31, 2002 compared to March 31, 2001.
Accordingly,  cash provided by operating  activities has been and is expected to
be a relatively stable source of cash flow.</P>

<P>Cash flows from investing activities results primarily from investment in and
payments  received  on  mortgage  and  interim  construction  loans  and  church
bonds.</P>

<P>Cash flows from financing  activities  relate primarily to the borrowings and
payments on notes payable and the line of credit.  Borrowings  are made as funds
are needed to make loans or as current  obligations  become due.  Based upon the
success of the Trust to obtain  borrowings  in the past,  the Trust is confident
that it will be able to obtain  borrowings in the future in sufficient  amounts,
along with  payments to be received  on loans,  to timely meet its  obligations.
Furthermore,  the Trust is confident  that if it decides to register  additional
Certificates  in the  future,  it would have  similar  success  in  selling  the
Certificates as it has had in the past.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>-12-</FONT></H1>

<PAGE>

<P><B>Inflation</B></P>

<P>At March 31, 2002,  the weighted  average  interest rate on the mortgage loan
and church bond  portfolio  of the Trust was 9.14% per annum while the  weighted
average  interest  rate upon all  borrowings  of the Trust was 3.75% per  annum.
Although a majority of the loans  constituting  the loan  portfolio of the Trust
have been made at  variable  rates of interest  that  generally  reprice  either
daily, annually, or otherwise periodically,  a portion of the loans constituting
the  Trust's  loan  portfolio  have been  made at fixed  rates of  interest  and
therefore are not subject to being increased or decreased during the term of the
loan. All of the indebtedness of the Trust is either directly or indirectly tied
to the  prime  rate of  interest  charged  by major  banking  institutions  and,
therefore,  is subject to  fluctuation.  During periods of inflation,  the prime
rate of interest charged by major banking institutions,  as well as the interest
rate  or  cost  of  borrowing  money  from  any  lender,   generally  increases.
Consequently,  during an inflationary  period the interest  expense of the Trust
would  increase.  Since the  interest  income of the Trust would not increase as
rapidly, an increase in the interest expense of the Trust would decrease the net
income of the Trust.  However,  interest income should subsequently  increase as
variable  rate loans  reprice.  Should the amount of the loans and the amount of
the indebtedness of the Trust remain  constant,  and should the weighted average
interest rate upon the indebtedness  increase to approximately 16.61% per annum,
the interest income and the interest expense of the Trust would be substantially
equal.</P>

<P><B>New Accounting Standards</B></P>

<P>On April 1, 2001,  the Trust adopted  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board
Statement  No.  133,   <I>Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging
Activities</I>.  The adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact
on the Trust's financial statements.</P>

<P>In June 2001, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,  <I>Business  Combinations</I>,  and No.
142,  <I>Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets</I>,  effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. Under the new rules,  goodwill and intangible
assets deemed to have  indefinite  lives will no longer be amortized but will be
subject to annual  impairment  tests in accordance  with the  Statements.  Other
intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives.</P>

<P>The  Trust  will apply the new rules on  accounting  for  goodwill  and other
intangible  assets  as of  April 1,  2002.  Application  of the  nonamortization
provisions of the  statement  will not have an effect on net income as the Trust
currently has no goodwill or other intangibles.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT</H2>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>The Board of Trust Managers and Shareholders<BR>
Church Loans &amp; Investments Trust<BR>
Amarillo, Texas</H4>

<P>We  have  audited  the  accompanying  balance  sheets of Church  Loans  &amp;
Investments  Trust (a real  estate  investment  trust) as of March 31,  2002 and
2001, and the related statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows
for the years then ended.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of
the Trust's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.</P>

<P>We  conducted our audits in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards  require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

<P>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects,  the financial position of Church Loans &amp; Investments
Trust as of March 31,  2002 and 2001,  and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the years then ended in  conformity  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.</P>

(A Real Estate Investment Trust)<br>
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies<br>
March 31, 2002 and 2001</H4>

<H4>NATURE OF OPERATIONS</H4>

<P>Church  Loans  &amp;  Investments  Trust  (Church  Loans)  is a  real  estate
investment  trust that invests  primarily  in mortgage and interim  construction
loans to churches  and other  borrowers  (see note 1) across the United  States,
particularly in the southern portion of the United States. Church Loans requires
that real estate  properties be pledged against loans as security which could be
foreclosed  by Church  Loans  should the  borrower  default.  Repayment  of each
borrower's  obligations  is generally  expected to be repaid from  contributions
from  church  members  or from  operations  of the  borrower,  or in the case of
interim construction loans, by permanent financing provided by others.</P>


<H4>USE OF ESTIMATES</H4>

<P>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting  period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.</P>


<H4>CURRENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT</H4>

<P>Church  Loans has  historically  invested in long-term,  fixed-rate  mortgage
loans,  generally  funded by relatively  short-term debt obligations and secured
savings  certificates  (SSCs).  The  volatility of interest  rates and increased
competition  to attract  customers'  funds have caused Church  Loans'  liability
structure to become  short-term and rate  sensitive.  Church Loans  reflected an
average  interest  yield on its loan  and  church  bond  portfolio,  an  average
interest rate on its total  indebtedness and a net interest rate margin at March
31, 2002 and 2001 as follows:</P>

                        ---------------           ------------         ------------
March 31, 2002               9.14%                    3.75%                5.39%
March 31, 2001              10.28%                    7.00%                3.28%
</PRE>

<P>Church  Loans finances  maturities of SSCs and debt  obligations  through its
available  lines of credit and principal  payments  received on its mortgage and
interim construction loans.</P>


<H4>CHURCH BONDS</H4>

<P>Church  bonds,  secured by first  mortgage  liens on church  facilities,  are
stated at cost,  as there is no  traded  market  for the  bonds  and  management
intends to hold such securities until maturity.

(A Real Estate Investment Trust)<br>
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies<br>

<H4>LOANS</H4>

<P>Loans  that  Church  Loans  has  the  intent  and  ability  to  hold  for the
foreseeable  future or until maturity or pay-off generally are reported at their
outstanding  unpaid principal  balances adjusted for charge-offs,  the allowance
for credit losses, and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans.  Interest
income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of
certain direct  origination  costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment
of the related loan yield.
</P>
<P>The accrual of interest is generally  discontinued  on loans and church bonds
more than 60 days past due unless the credit is well  secured  and in process of
collection.  In  all  cases,  loans  and  bonds  are  placed  on  nonaccrual  or
charged-off  at an earlier  date if  collection  of  principal  or  interest  is
considered doubtful.</P>

<P>All  interest  accrued  but not  collected  for  loans  that  are  placed  on
nonaccrual or charged-off is reversed against  interest income.  The interest on
these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or  cost-recovery  method,  until
qualifying for return to accrual.  Loans are returned to accrual status when all
the principal and interest  amounts  contractually  due are brought  current and
future payments are reasonably assured.</P>

<P>Commitment  fees received on interim  construction  loans are recognized over
the interim  commitment  period for loans that are not  permanently  financed by
Church  Loans  and  over  the  life of the  mortgage  loan  for  loans  that are
permanently  financed by Church  Loans.  Amounts are being  amortized  using the
straight-line  method. This method was not materially  different from the method
of deferring  commitment  fees until the commitment is exercised and recognizing
such fees as an  adjustment  to yield by the  interest  method  over the related
loans' lives as prescribed by generally accepted  accounting  principles for the
years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001.</P>

<P>Purchase discounts on loans are amortized based on the interest method.</P>

<H4>ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES</H4>

<P>The  allowance  for credit losses is  established  as losses are estimated to
have occurred  through a provision for credit losses  charged to earnings.  Loan
losses are  charged  against  the  allowance  when  Church  Loans  believes  the
uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed.  Subsequent recoveries, if any,
are credited to the allowance.
</P>

<P>The  allowance  for credit  losses is evaluated on a regular  basis by Church
Loans and is based upon  management's and the board of trust managers'  periodic
review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience, the
nature and volume of the loan portfolio,  adverse situations that may affect the
borrower's  ability to repay,  estimated value of any underlying  collateral and
prevailing economic conditions.  This evaluation is inherently  subjective as it
requires  estimates  that  are  susceptible  to  significant  revision  as  more
information becomes available.

<H4>ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (CONTINUED)</H4>

<P>A loan is considered  impaired when, based on current information and events,
it is  probable  that  Church  Loans  will be unable to  collect  the  scheduled
payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of
the loan agreement. Factors considered by Church Loans in determining impairment
include  payment  status,  collateral  value,  and the probability of collecting
scheduled  principal  and  interest  payments  when due.  Loans that  experience
insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified
as impaired.</P>

<P>Church  Loans  determines  the  significance  of payment  delays and  payment
shortfalls  on a  case-by-case  basis,  taking  into  consideration  all  of the
circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the
delay, the reasons for the delay,  the borrower's prior payment record,  and the
amount  of the  shortfall  in  relation  to the  principal  and  interest  owed.
Impairment  is measured on a  loan-by-loan  basis by either the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the
loan's  obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan
is collateral dependent.</P>


<H4>PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT</H4>

<P>Property  and equipment are stated at cost,  less  accumulated  depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on the  straight-line  method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets.</P>


<H4>REAL ESTATE ACQUIRED THROUGH FORECLOSURE</H4>

<P>Real estate acquired  through,  or in lieu of, loan foreclosure is to be sold
and is  initially  recorded  at  estimated  fair  value  at date of  foreclosure
establishing a new cost basis. Other real estate owned,  after  foreclosure,  is
carried at the lower of carrying  amount or the property's  estimated fair value
minus estimated costs to sell (fair value). Declines in the estimated fair value
below cost are recognized as a valuation allowance.  If the estimated fair value
subsequently  increases  above its carrying  value,  the valuation  allowance is
reduced,  but not below zero.  Increases or decreases in the valuation allowance
are charged or credited to operations.
</P>

<P>The  valuation of other real estate owned is  subjective in nature and may be
adjusted  in the near term  because of changes in economic  conditions  or other
factors.</P>


<H4>INCOME TAXES</H4>

<P>Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  for the  future tax
consequences   attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial  statement
carrying  amounts of existing assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax
bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected  to apply to  taxable  income  in the  years in which  those  temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax
assets and  liabilities  of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.</P>

<H4>OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</H4>

<P>In  the  ordinary   course  of  business,   Church  Loans  has  entered  into
off-balance-sheet  financial  instruments  consisting of  commitments  to extend
credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when
they become payable.
</P>

<H4>CASH FLOWS</H4>

<P>For  purposes of  reporting  cash flows,  cash and cash  equivalents  include
cash-on-hand  and investment in a money market mutual fund and  certificates  of
deposit with maturities of less than 90 days at the time of acquisition.
</P>

<H4>NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS</H4>

<P>On April 1, 2001, Church Loans adopted Financial  Accounting  Standards Board
Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
The adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on Church Loans'
financial statements.
</P>

<P>In June 2001, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued Statements of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 141,  Business  Combinations,  and No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. Under the new rules, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to
have indefinite  lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual
impairment tests in accordance with the Statements. Other intangible assets will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives.</P>

<P>Church  Loans will apply the new rules on  accounting  for goodwill and other
intangible  assets  as of  April 1,  2002.  Application  of the  nonamortization
provisions  of the  Statement  will not have an effect  on net  income as Church
Loans currently has no goodwill or other intangibles.</P>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<br>
March 31, 2002 and 2001</H4>

<H4>NOTE 1 - LOANS AND CHURCH BONDS</H4>

<P>Mortgage  loans receivable  consist of conventional  loans of $30,640,302 and
$26,210,414  and church bonds of $751,809  and  $737,614 at  March 31,  2002 and
2001, respectively. Interim construction loans of $15,760,519 and $16,202,191 at
March 31, 2002 and 2001,  respectively,  consist  primarily of loans to churches
for the construction of church facilities and assisted living centers.  Mortgage
loans,  church bonds and interim  construction  loans are  generally  secured by
first liens on real estate  comprised  primarily of church  buildings  and other
real  estate.  The  amount of a loan is  generally  limited  to  66-2/3%  of the
appraised  value of the  related  property.  Certain  loans  are  guaranteed  by
individual  members of the  congregations or other individuals or congregations,
depending on the circumstances.</P>

<P>Church Loans'  portfolio  included  mortgage loans,  church bonds and interim
construction loans with interest rates ranging from 5% to 13% at March 31, 2002.
The weighted average annual interest rates of Church Loans' loan and church bond
portfolio were 9.14% and 10.28% at March 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.</P>

<P>In  addition to a  concentration  of loans to  churches,  Church  Loans makes
certain interim real estate  construction  loans and permanent loans to entities
other  than  churches.  At March 31,  2002,  Church  Loans had five loans to two
borrowers   which  were   secured  by  assisted   living   centers  and  totaled
approximately  $8,042,000. At March 31, 2001, Church Loans had six such loans to
two borrowers totaling approximately $13,105,000.</P>

and interim  construction loan portfolios by size of loan at March 31,  2002 and

<H4>NOTE 2 - DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CONTINUED)</H4>

<P>Descriptions of the various categories of debt obligations follow:</P>

<H4>Secured Savings Certificates</H4>

<P>SSCs were issued in amounts of $1,000 or more and have single  maturity dates
from 30 days to 10 years  from  date of issue.  With  respect  to an  individual
certificate, interest rate and frequency of payment of interest (either monthly,
quarterly,  semiannually,  annually  or at  maturity)  are  fixed at the time of
issuance of the certificate.  Effective July 1997, Church Loans discontinued the
sale  of  SSCs.  At  March  30,  2002  and  2001,   Church  Loans  had  no  SSCs
outstanding.</P>

<H4>Line of Credit Payable to Bank</H4>

<P>The  line of credit  payable  to bank  consists  of  borrowings  under a loan
agreement effective through  December 30,  2002, that provides for a $15,000,000
line of credit with certain  commitment fees. The loan agreement requires Church
Loans to pledge mortgage loans receivable having unpaid principal  balances with
an  aggregate  present  value,  discounted  at 2% over the prime rate  (6.75% at
March 31,  2002),  of not less than 110% of all  indebtedness  owed to the bank.
Interest  accrued  at the prime  rate  less one  percent  during  2002 and 2001.
Interest is payable semiannually.</P>

<P>Additionally,  the line of credit requires that Church Loans' net worth be no
less than  $18,000,000 and its total  indebtedness  shall not exceed 150% of its
net worth. At March 31, 2002, Church Loans' total indebtedness was approximately
$6,000,000 less than the maximum amount permitted under the agreement.</P>

<H4>Demand Notes Payable</H4>

<P>The  demand  notes  payable  bear  interest  at 1% less than the  prime  rate
(payable monthly) and are unsecured (see note 6).</P>


<H4>NOTE 3 - INCOME TAX PROVISION</H4>

<P>Church Loans has elected to be taxed as a real estate  investment trust under
the  provisions  of the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  To qualify  as a real  estate
investment  trust  under  the Code,  Church  Loans  must,  among  other  things,
distribute at least 90% and 95% for 2002 and 2001, respectively,  of its taxable
income to its shareholders  through  dividends.  Church Loans is required to pay
dividends  of at  least  85%  of  its  calendar  year  undistributed  income  by
subsequent February 1 or be subject to a special federal excise tax of 4% on the
undistributed amount.</P>

<H4>NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES</H4>

<P>Church Loans is a party to financial instruments with  off-balance-sheet risk
in the normal course of business. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to
lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established
in the contract.  Commitments  generally  have variable  interest  rates,  fixed
expiration  dates or other  termination  clauses and  require  payment of a fee.
Since some of the  commitments  may expire  without being drawn upon,  the total
commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Church
Loans  evaluates each  customer's  credit  worthiness on a  case-by-case  basis.
Collateral  generally  includes real estate  properties.  The exposure to credit
loss in the event of  nonperformance  by the other party to the  commitments  to
extend  credit is  represented  by the  contractual  amount.  At March 31, 2002,
Church  Loans  had  outstanding  loan  commitments  (by  contract   amounts)  of
approximately $9,959,000.  Management does not anticipate any losses as a result
of these transactions.</P>

<P>Church  Loans is involved in litigation in the normal course of business and,
in the opinion of management,  such  litigation  will have no material effect on
Church Loans' financial statements.</P>

<H4>NOTE 9 - DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</H4>

<P>The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial  instruments,  the results of applying  such methods and
assumptions to the financial  instruments and limitations inherent in fair value
estimates:</P>

<H4>Cash and Cash Equivalents</H4>

<P>The  assets are  considered  short-term  instruments  for which the  carrying
amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.</P>

<H4>Loans and Church Bonds</H4>

<P>Fair  values are  estimated for  portfolios  of loans with similar  financial
characteristics.  Loans are  segregated  by type,  such as mortgage  and interim
construction  loans and church bonds.  Each loan  category is further  segmented
into  fixed  and  adjustable  rate  interest  terms.  For  variable-rate  loans,
primarily  interim  construction  loans,  that  reprice  frequently  and with no
significant  change in credit risk,  fair values are based on carrying  amounts.
The fair value of fixed-rate  mortgage loans and bonds is generally estimated by
discounting  the future cash flows  through  the  estimated  maturity  using the
current  rates at which  similar  loans would be made to borrowers  with similar
credit  ratings.  The estimate of maturity is based on Church Loans'  historical
experience with repayments for each loan classification,  modified, as required,
by an estimate of the effect of current  economic  and lending  conditions.  The
carrying  value of loans and bonds,  net of the  allowance for credit losses was
$45,228,382  and  $41,162,733  and  the  fair  value  of  loans  and  bonds  was
approximately   $50,600,000   and  $41,700,000  at  March  31,  2002  and  2001,
respectively.</P>

<H4>Notes Payable and Line of Credit</H4>

<P>The  fair  value of notes  payable  and the line of  credit  are equal to the
carrying value as such liabilities are deemed to be short-term borrowings.</P>

<H4>Commitments to Extend Credit</H4>

<P>Generally,   Church  Loans  enters  into  commitments  to  extend  credit  at
adjustable  interest terms.  Accordingly,  the commitment amount is a reasonable
estimate of fair value.</P>

<H4>Other</H4>

<P>The carrying  amounts of notes  receivable and accrued  interest  approximate
fair value.</P>

<H4>NOTE  9  -  DISCLOSURE  ABOUT  THE  FAIR  VALUE  OF  FINANCIAL   INSTRUMENTS
(CONTINUED)</H4>

<H4>Limitations</H4>

<P>Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time,  based on relevant
market  information  and  information  about  the  financial  instrument.  These
estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering
for sale at one time Church  Loans'  entire  holdings of a particular  financial
instrument.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of Church Loans'
financial  instruments,  fair value  estimates are based on judgments  regarding
future   expected   loss   experience,   current   economic   conditions,   risk
characteristics  of various  financial  instruments,  and other  factors.  These
estimates  are  subjective  in nature and involve  uncertainties  and matters of
significant  judgment  and,  therefore,  cannot be  determined  with  precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.</P>
