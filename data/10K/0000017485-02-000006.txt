<pre>ITEM 1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</STRONG>

	<STRIKE></STRIKE>Cardiff Communications, Inc.,  (&quot;the Company&quot;) was organized in December 1906 in the State
of Utah under the name Cardiff Mining &amp; Milling Company.  During the 60's the Company changed its name
to Cardiff Industries, Inc. and sold its mining operations.  During the next decade the Company focused its
operations on the television and radio industry.  Subsequently, the name was changed to Cardiff
Communications in 1980.   Subsequent to the period encompassed in this filing, the Company changed it's
domicile to the state of Nevada.  The Company has had no operations in the last 10 years.

	The board of directors feel that the Company does not meet the criteria of a development stage
company (as defined in SFAS 7 &quot;<EM>Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises</EM>&quot;) primarily
because it is not currently producing or marketing a product or service. However, the Company is currently
seeking a business opportunity to merge with or acquire, but to date has not located any such business
opportunities.

	In seeking a business opportunity to merge with or acquire, management is reviewing various
business plans. Management has not limited their review of plans or exploration of acquisitions to any
particular industry or service sector. Though there appears to be a large number of companies seeking to
merge with an existing public company, the management has not yet identified a business to complete such
a transaction with and the Company has not entered into any binding agreements for an acquisition or
merger. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in finding any business opportunity to
merge with or acquire.
<STRIKE>
</STRIKE>
<STRONG>ITEM 2.  DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY</STRONG>

	The Company currently maintains its corporate presence from the office of the Company's
legal counsel and pays no rent or expenses.

STOCKHOLDER MATTERS</STRONG>
</pre>
<PRE>
	The Company is not currently trading in any public markets and  has not been able to obtain any
reliable trading history for the period reported.   As of September 30, 1999, the Company had approximately
1,165  shareholders of record.

	The Company has not declared any cash dividends on its Common Stock in the last thirty years<STRIKE></STRIKE>
and its Board of Directors has no present intention of declaring any dividends.  For the foreseeable future,
the Company intends to retain all earnings, if any, for use in the development and expansion of its business.

</PRE>
<PRE>
<STRONG>ITEM 6.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
         AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</STRONG>

Financial Condition

	The Company had revenue of $634 during the year ended September 30, 1999.  Total
stockholders' equity was  $10,634, as compared to a deficit of $(63,000) at September 30, 1998. The
Company has  no operating capital for future operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

	The Company has no liquid assets and is currently in the process of looking for business
opportunities to merge with or acquire.  At minimum, the Company will need to raise additional capital
through private funding to meet the financial needs of being a reporting company.  Historically, the
Company has been successful in raising operational capital.  There is no guarantee that the Company
will be successful in obtaining necessary funding to develop any business opportunities.

Results of Operations

	 The Company reported a net loss of $2,366 for the year ended September 30, 1999, compared
to a  loss of $3,000 for the previous year.  The Company anticipates very little or no overhead from future
operations until a successor business can be acquired or merged.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT</PRE>
<PRE>Stockholders and Directors
Cardiff Communications, Inc.
Salt Lake City, Utah


     We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Cardiff Communications, Inc. as of September 30,
1999 and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the years ended
September 30, 1999 and 1998.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express and opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

     We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Cardiff Communications, Inc. at September 30, 1999, and the results of its operations
and cash flows for the years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.</PRE>
<PRE>
     The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue
as a going concern.  As discussed in Note 5, the Company's recurring operating losses and lack of working
capital raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard
to those matters are also described in Note 5. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 2 USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues

NOTE 5  GOING CONCERN

     The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as
a going concern.  The company has had recurring operating losses for the past several years and is
dependent upon financing to continue operations.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of uncertainty. It is management's plan to find an operating company to
merge with, thus creating necessary operating revenue.

We hereby consent to the use of our audit report of Cardiff Communications, Inc. dated  for the year ended
September 30, 1999 in the Form 10KSB Annual Report for the year 1999.</PRE>
