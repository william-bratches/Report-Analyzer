                             PART I

Item 1	Business

The Registrant's operations are presently conducted through its Precision
Instrument Division located in Monrovia, California. The product presently
being produced by the Precision Instrument Division consist  of a line of
uninterruptible power supplies (U.P.S.) ranging in size from 500va to 37.5 kva.
The U.P.S.  is a power system that can both smooth out voltage fluctuations
and maintain a power load under power blackout conditions. U.P.S.'s are
designed to provided fifteen minutes or more(depending on number of batteries)
of support power to computers, scientific products, communications systems, or
similar equipment should utility power fail. While the utility power is availa-
ble, the U.P.S. provides isolation from voltage or frequency which disturb the
systems operation.

The registrant markets the U.P.S. trough trade publications, tradeshows and
telemarketing. However, sales are generally made by the Registrant through
distributors who sell the products to end-users. For the year 1996,
Nova Power System, a major distributor through its direct and indirect sales
accounted for more than thirty percent of the Registrant's total sales.

The Registrant assembles finished components and other materials to produce
its products. Relatively little fabrication of raw materials is done by the
Registrant. The Registrant purchases imported raw material and finished
components used in production of the Registrant's products.  Thus, the
Registrant is dependent upon the ability of suppliers to meet performance
specifications, quality standard and delivery schedules. The Registrant
endeavors to assure availability of sources of supplies and does not antici-
pate any shortages which would adversely affect production schedules. 

Competition - The markets for the registrant's products highly competitive.
The  Registrant is aware of approximately forty competitors for on-line UPS
products. Many of these companies have far greater financial resources than the
registrant. The Registrant competes primarily on the basis of the quality,
reliability and technical sophistication of its products, although price
remains an important factor. The registrant attempts to locates niche markets
for UPS products where greater reliability is required by customer. 

Substantially all of the Registrant's products are subject of ongoing
modification and I improvment and are subject to scientific and technological
changes.

Backlog - The following table sets forth the amounts representing orders
believed by the Registrant to be firm. The backlog at December 31,1996
represents orders which the Registrant expects to deliver during 1997.
There are no seasonal effects on orders.


FIRM BACKLOG AS OF DECEMBER 31,1996: $78,860.

FIRM BACKLOG AS OF DECEMBER 31,1995: $209,045.


Other - As of December 31,1996, the Registrant employed 25 people, all of
        which are full-time employees.

Other required information as to the Registrant's description of business
operations and its development is incorporated herein by reference to pages
1 through 3 in the Registrant's 1996 Annual Report to Shareholders and the
Registrant's  financial statements contained therein, each incorporated by
reference in this report.

During fiscal 1996 properties were utilized at approximately 60% of
capacity

The Registrant believes its properties are suitable for its needs.



Item 3.	Legal Proceedings

In 1996 the company entered into a verbal distributor agreement granting a
distributor the non-exclusive rights to distribute certain products of its
former CAD division. In 1991, the company filed suit to recover the
uncollected balance of its receivable due from the distributor.
The distributor filed a countersuit alleging misrepresentation.
On May 24,1993 the jury awarded the distributor net damages of approximately
$264,000 including double damages, legal cost and interest. In November 1993,
the Company filed  and appeal against this judgment and provided a supersedeas
bond secured by $300,000 certificate of deposit. On November 8,1994, the
Court of Appeals issued an order reversing the trial courts judgment against
the Company. On January 23,1995 the distributor files an Application for
Writ of Error with the Supreme Court of Texas. On July 7,1995, the Supreme
Court of Texas ordered the judgment of the Court of appeals be reversed and
the cause be remanded back to that court for further proceedings. On July 20,
1995, the company filed a motion for Rehearing with the Supreme Court.
On May 6,1996, the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for
consideration on the merits aside from the previous issues submitted to them.

Management has estimated a range of amounts for the potential loss, including
legal costs, relating to this matter and an amount considered management to
be the probable loss was provided for in the statement of operations for 1993
as loss from discontinued operations. After the Supreme Court ordered the 
judgement of the Court of Appeals be reversed, the Company established additio-
nal reserves in 1996. An unfavorable resolution of this matter to the company
could result in an additional liability of approximately $150,000 which has
not been reflected in the financial statements.
