CORNING NATURAL GAS CORPORATION
FORM 10-KSB
For the 12 Month Period Ended September 30, 1997
Part I

ITEM 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
(a)  Business Development
Corning Natural Gas Corporation (the "Company" or "Registrant"), incorporated
in 1904, is a natural gas utility.  The Company purchases its entire supply of
gas, and distributes it through its own pipeline distribution and transmission
systems to residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers in the
Corning, New York area and to two other gas utilities which service the Elmira
and Bath, New York areas.  The Company is under the jurisdiction of the Public
Service Commission of New York State which oversees and sets rates for New
York gas distribution companies.  The Company also sells, leases and services
appliances, primarily gas burning, through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Corning Natural Gas Appliance Corporation.
(b)  Business of Issuer
    (1)  The Company maintains a gas supply portfolio of numerous contracts
and is not dependent on a single supplier.  Additionally, the Company has
capabilities for storing 793,000 Mcf through storage operations with two of
its suppliers.  The Company had no curtailments during fiscal 1997 and expects
to have an adequate supply available for its customers during fiscal 1998
providing that no abnormal conditions or actions occur.
    (2)  The Company is franchised to supply gas service in all the
political subdivisions in which it operates.
    (3)  Since the Company's business is seasonal by quarters, sales for
 each quarter of the year vary and are not comparable.  Sales for different
periods vary depending on variations in temperature, but the Company's Weather
Normalization Clause (WNC) serves to stabilize net revenue from the effects of
temperature variations.  The WNC allows the Company to adjust customer
billings to compensate for fluctuations in net revenue caused by temperatures
which are higher or lower than the thirty year average temperature for the
period.  Degree days, which represent the number of degrees that the average
daily temperature falls below 65 degrees Fahrenheit, totaled 6,831 for the
period October 1, 1996 through September 30, 1997 and 7,076 for the same
period ended September 30, 1996.
    (4)  The Company has three major customers, Corning Incorporated, New
York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG), and Bath Electric, Gas & Water Systems
(BEGWS).  The loss of any of these customers could have a significant impact
on the Company's financial results.
    (5)  Historically, the Company's competition in the residential market
has been primarily from electricity in cooking, water heating and clothes
drying, and to a very small degree, in heating.  The price of gas remains low
in comparison to that of electricity in the Company's service territory and
the Company's competitive position in the residential market continues to be
very strong.  Approximately 99% of the Company's general service customers
heat with gas.
    In recent years competition from oil has developed in the industrial
 market.  The Company has been able to counteract much of this competition, to
date, through the transportation of customer owned gas for a transportation
charge.  The customer arranges for their own gas supply, then moves it through
the Company's facilities for a transportation fee.  The Company's
transportation rate is equal to the lowest unit rate of the appropriate rate
classification, exclusive of gas costs, hence the profit margin is maintained.
    Additionally, under an increasingly deregulated environment there is
opportunity for the Company to increase revenue by selling its upstream
pipeline capacity to transportation customers.  The Company is authorized to
retain 15% of such revenue and 85% is returned to firm customers in the form
of lower gas costs.  Transportation customers that pay for this capacity are
virtually assured that their supply will not be interrupted.  Revenues derived
from the resale of this capacity were $242,289 for 12 months ended September
30, 1997 and $181,681 for the 12 months ended September 30, 1996.
    For those willing to bear some risk, the Company has an interruptible
transportation rate for its large industrial customers whereby the customer
may elect to avoid payment of demand charges but bears the risk of partial or
total upstream interruption of service during certain periods.  To maintain
industrial load in the event that oil prices temporarily drop below the
equivalent gas price, the Company continues to maintain a flexible
transportation rate schedule.  This flexible rate has been used infrequently
since its inception.
    In September 1995 the Company purchased the assets of a local gas
distribution company, Finger Lakes Gas Company, through the Federal Bankruptcy
Court.  Finger Lakes Gas served customers in the Hammondsport, NY area and had
a customer base of approximately 320 customers.  The Company was able to
purchase this all plastic system with a bid of $560,000.  The Company was
pleased to purchase these assets that originally cost over $1.5 million to
construct for its relatively low bid.  The nearly new, all plastic, system was
already connected and serving 320 customers with a potential to add 200 more
in the near future.  On a per customer basis, this represents a very low
investment.  The capital to purchase these assets was obtained through short
term debt.  The Company has not found it necessary to apply for an increase in
rates on this part of our system which means the original rates made effective
in 1990 remain in effect currently.
    Shortly after the Company took possession of the system, Mercury
Aircraft, Inc. announced it would purchase the former Taylor Wine Company
facilities and centralize their other plants.  The reopening of this major
facility will most certainly contribute toward the stability and future
viability of the new gas system which is now part of the Company.  The former
Finger Lakes Gas Company's operations contributed in excess of $150,000 to
gross margin for the period ended September 30, 1996, and in excess of
$218,000 for the 12 months ended September 30, 1997.
    In December, 1994 the New York Public Service Commission instituted a
proceeding to address issues related to the merging competitive natural gas
market.  This proceeding is intended to provide a framework whereby access to
facilities on upstream pipelines made available by FERC Order 636 would be
available to end use customers on the Local Distribution Company level.  New
tariff filings were approved and became effective September 1, 1996.  The
Company considers this a transitional step towards full unbundling of services
with future changes made as circumstances warrant.
    In 1997 the PSC instituted another proceeding designed to assess the
issues associated with the future of the natural gas industry and the role of
the local gas utility.  The staff of the PSC has made certain proposals which,
if instituted, will effectively separate the structure of the industry into
four distinct segments.  Under the proposed structure, production,
transportation, marketing and distribution will become distinct businesses. 
Gas utilities would no longer sell natural gas, they would merely provide the
distribution facilities to get gas to the burnertip.  The PSC staff proposal
indicates that this change should be complete within five years.
    Such a drastic change will obviously require much effort in working out
 the details to ensure that customers are provided with the same safe,
reliable service that has historically been provided.  This company has taken
the position that it does not oppose this transition to a fully competitive
market but that it must be allowed to evolve naturally.  In order to minimize
the potential for unintended consequences which could have a negative effect
on the customer, arbitrary deadlines and regulations designed to accelerate
the process need to be avoided.  If, in fact, marketers can provide a more
economic product than the gas utility, customers will be quick to respond.
    (6)  The Company believes compliance with present federal, state and
local provisions relating to the protection of the environment will not have
any material adverse effect on capital expenditures, earnings and financial
position of the Company and its subsidiary.
    (7)  Sixty-nine persons were employed on a full-time basis and seven on
a part-time basis by the Company in 1997 and 67 full-time and six part-time in
fiscal 1996.
    (8)  The Company's labor-management relationship is good.  Typical labor
 negotiations are completed in one to two days.  The current labor contract
was signed September 1, 1995 for a three year period.
ITEM 2 - DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
    The Company completed the construction of a new office building at 330
West William Street, Corning, NY in the fall of 1991.  This structure is
physically connected to the operations center built three years earlier.  The
Company had outgrown its general offices at 27 East Denison Parkway.  The
property has been sold, and the gain on the sale was returned to ratepayers. 
    The Company's pipeline system is thoroughly surveyed each year.  Any
necessary replacements are included in the construction budget.  Approximately
105 miles of transmission main, 284 miles of distribution main, 13,800
services and 86 measuring and regulating stations, along with various other
property are distributed throughout the service area.  All of the above
described property is owned by the Company, except for one short section of
10" gas main which is under a long-term lease and is used primarily to serve
Corning Incorporated.  All of the above described property which is owned by
the Company is adequately insured, and is subject to the lien of the Company's
first mortgage indenture.

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
    The Company is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings,
nor is the Company aware of any problems of any consequence which it
anticipates may result in legal proceedings.

ITEM 4 - SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
    No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the third

Letter to Shareholders

    It appears that New York State has turned the economic corner and is finally
 headed uphill again.  A new, energized state government with a revised view
 of business and taxes has made real strides to improve the state's economic
 climate.  Taxes and worker's compensation insurance costs have been cut,
 business expansion and job development is the order of the day while
 unemployment and welfare costs have declined.  The City of Corning and the
 Southern Finger Lakes region in general are participants in this revival.
    In the past several years the region surrounding Corning has developed into
 a major shopping hub and tourist center.  Major initiatives are underway to
 vastly enrich and expand the tourist market.  Equally as important to our
 Company are the many sizable business expansion projects that are now in
 various stages of construction and development.  So much is going on, in
 fact, that two sections of this report are devoted to outlining these
 developments.  While the economy of our service territory has been some-
 what stagnant in the past decade, we have been relatively successful in ex-
 panding our markets by building pipelines to adjacent villages,  connecting
 to schools, residences and businesses.  These major new local developments
 will bring new plants, businesses and residential construction into our
 back yard without major construction expenditures on our part.
    As difficult as it has been for the Company to develop new revenue sources,
 we have been able to sustain a moderate level of growth in our customer
 base and in net earnings while maintaining a stable, reasonable rate
 structure.  The year ended September 30, 1997 proved to be our most
 successful year to date, producing earnings of $1.64 per share.  Dividends
 paid of $1.28 per share brought our payout ratio down to a more favorable
 78 percent allowing for an increase in equity to $11.32 per share.  It is
 important to note the Company has been able to capitalize on various in-
 centive mechanisms along with continued good performance by the Appliance
 subsidiary to achieve this level of earnings.  For example, the Company
 increased its capacity assignment revenues by one third in the past year to
 $1.6 million thus returning nearly $1.4 million to customers through
 reduced rates while improving pre-tax earnings by $242,000.
    Serious ongoing efforts have been made throughout the past several years to
 reduce the gas lost on the system which can create large expenses.  We have
 aggressively been upgrading electronic gas measurement equipment at all
 major delivery points and have completed a program to install temperature
 correcting meters wherever meters are located outdoors.  During the year we
 purchased a computerized, electronic meter tester which will allow us to
 adjust our meters with pinpoint accuracy.  We have stepped up our progam
 to detect leakage and ititiate repairs.  These efforts have resulted in lower
 level of gas lost on the system.  Additionally, this accomplishment has
 also increased gross earnings due to an incentive mechanism that the state
 initiated several years ago.
    The Company's wholly owned Appliance Subsidiary also contributed $222,000
 to consolidated net earnings.  While this is not quite up to the level of the
 prior year, we are well positioned for growth in 1998.  Freestanding gas
 fireplace units and insert fireplace units are extremely popular with our
 customers.  All three of our stores' display areas have been recently
 redesigned to emphasize gas fired fireplaces.  The rental business remains
 strong with continued growth in the rental of water treatment equipment.

    Utility companies in New York State remain a prime source of tax revenue
 collection.  In fiscal 1997 the Company paid a total of $2,400,000 in
 various state and federal taxes.  Taxes on property and the gross revenue
 tax are the primary sources of the overall burden.  The good news is that
 the state has finally agreed to gradually reduce the 3.5 percent gross
 revenue tax down to 2.5 percent by January 1, 2000.  There are ongoing
 discussions at the state capital that this reduction is not as progressive
 as it should be if the state is toachieve its goal of significantly
 reducing energy costs in order to improve its business development agenda.
 Legislation has also been enacted which will eventually result in a
 decrease in property taxes. 
    Late in September, 1997, the Company completed a long-term debt financing
 in the amount of $4.7 million.  These funds were obtained as a senior note
 with interest at 7.9 percent over a 20 year term.  This financing allowed
 the Company to reduce short-term debt in the amount of $3.1 million and to
 retire a 10 percent bond with a balance of $1.6 million.  Savings of over
 $200,000 were achieved on the bond retirement while the entire package
 served to strengthen the capitalization structure.
    While legislators, politicians and consumers across the nation and
 particularly in New York voice their concern regarding energy costs, our
 rates continue to be competitive.  It is true that regulated energy utility
 rates are generally high in New York State, particularly electric costs,
 and that affirmative action needs to be taken to reduce these costs.  This
 is not necessarily true for natural gas rates charged by many of the New
 York utility companies.  According to a recent American Gas Association
 study, retail prices for natural gas for all consuming sectors were on
 average 18 percent lower in 1996 than in 1987, when the effects of
 wellhead price deregulation began to appear.  The wellhead price of natural
 gas increased only slightly during the past decade, from $2.21 per thousand
 cubic feet in 1987 to $2.24 in 1996, although volatility during that period
 was significant.  The average retail price for the typical residential
 consumer in Corning's service territory was $6.15 per Mcf five years ago,
 in December 1992, compared with rates of only $5.99 per Mcf going into
 the winter of 1997-8.  The Company's rate structure positions us to compete
 for our residential and commercial business and to maintain our industrial
 loads in this new arena of deregulation.

    Our record of paying dividends to shareholders extends to 45 years of
 consecutive quarterly payments with the February, 1998 dividend.  This
 payment of 32.5 cents per common share brings the annualized payout to
 $1.30 per share.  Once again, we recognize and appreciate the work and
 dedication of our team of employees who pull together each day to produce
 quality results and satisfied customers.  We all look forward with
 enthusiasm toward the completion of the many exciting projects underway in
 the Corning area which will provide our Company with an increased and more
 viable base upon which we will build our future.

April 2000

    Corning Incorporated's $58 million investment in an all new Corning Glass
 Center inspired the community to plan for numerous changes to prepare
 itself to welcome 650,000 visitors to the area annually.  Approximately
 1,500 people, representing a cross-section of the community, have
 participated in the planning process.  Dozens of task forces and
 sub-committees were established to carry out the plan.  While many of the
 projects are already underway and funded or partially funded, some are
 more long-term, lower-priority, programs that may be completed in the future.
 The following is a partial review of the April 2000 initiatives.
    One of the major goals is to provide quality attractions, services and
 facilities to make tourists feel welcome and to stay longer in the area.
 The Corning Glass Center will be a prime magnet for visitors but there are
 many other things to see and do in the region.  The major attractions are
 the Finger Lakes, wineries, Watkins Glen race track, Rockwell (Western Art)
 Museum, National Warplane Museum and airshow, Soarplane Museum and soaring
 activities, Curtiss Museum (historic aviation), and the fall foliage.  The
 number one priority of April 2000 was to establish a regional marketing
 plan to maximize the utilization of all the region has to offer.  This
 rather extensive plan is progressing rapidly.
    The following is a brief listing of the major capital projects currently
 scheduled for completion by April 2000:
* Comprehensive Intown Signage System including information signs and
 community directories
* Visitor Center Parking Lot
* Visitor Center Pavilion
* Intown Streetscape Enhancements including a floral festival on Market and
 Bridge Streets
* Bridge Street Bridge Reconstruction - rebuild and enhance the bridge,
 a $6 million project
* River Loop hiking and bike trail
* Market Street Visitors Center
* Reconstruction of Denison Parkway - widen the sidewalks, improve street
 lighting and beautify the parkway - a major project funded and underway
* Market Street trolley shuttle
* Transportation Center - tour bus parking
* Civic Center Plaza Upgrade
    Additionally, this is a listing of a few of the other major long-term
 projects that hopefully will be highlighted in future reports as they
 become realities:
* Steuben Conference Center
* Glass Pavilion/Museum on Centerway pedestrian bridge
* Corning Intown Lake/Dam Project
* Executive hotel and riverfront residential development
* Boathouse
* Redevelopment of current firehouse and construction of a new fire station
* Construction of a new post office center
* Development of an intown business park
    As you can imagine, this is an exciting time for this community as it
 looks towards significant growth, capital additions, job development and
 numerous enhancements unmatched in the City's history.  In the Erwin area
 alone there are over 500 new housing units scheduled for construction over
 the next three years.  Corning Natural Gas Corporation looks forward to
 providing its services and participating in this new era.

New Business Development

    The area's largest employer and globally renowned Fortune 500
organization, Corning Incorporated, is having a revival of its own.  It is
obviously important that we follow and understand the progress of this ever
expanding organization due to the tremendous impact it has upon the economy
and well being of the citizens and businesses that make up the City of
Corning.  In the next few years to come, culminating in the spring of 2000,
Corning Incorporated will be investing approximately $250 million in new and
expanded manufacturing facilities, research facilities and its famous Museum
of Glass.  Several years ago Corning Incorporated decided to totally renovate
the Glass Museum by year 2000 to celebrate its 50th anniversary and the 150th
anniversary of Corning Incorporated.  This massive renovation represents an
investment of $58 million and is expected to draw 650,000 visitors annually,
nearly double the current figure.  In order to welcome these visitors and
benefit from these resources, the entire community needed to make numerous
physical and promotional changes.  This undertaking was carefully put together
as the project came to be known as April 2000.  This project encompasses so
many facets that it is reviewed as a separate section in this report.
    Without a doubt, the most important economic development to occur in the
past several years was the announcement that Corning Incorporated would
construct a 400,000 square foot, $40 million manufacturing facility in Erwin
to produce products for its Opto-Electronic Components Division.  This plant
will provide up to 1,000 new manufacturing jobs and will be partially operable
by year end, 1997.  The plant will produce products that combine with fiber
optic cable to upgrade the system, amplify optical signals, couple optic
systems, etc.  Corning Incorporated will also expend $4 million to enlarge its
center for fiber optic testing.
    Perhaps the most ambitious of Corning Incorporated's many projects is
the expansion of its impressive Sullivan Science Research Center located
adjacent to the new components plant.  This $125 million expansion will double
the size of the research center.  These additional buildings, totaling 328,000
square feet, will provide additional laboratories to create and test products,
conference space and a five story draw tower for specialty optic fibers.  500
additional employees will be needed, many who will have advanced scientific,
engineering and mathematics degrees.
    The expansion-minded company, which earned $487 million on $3.7 billion
in sales in 1996 is also investing $20 million to add to its recently
constructed world headquarters building in the center of the city.  The new
west wing will house some 350 workers in the Telecommunications Products and
Photonics Technologies Divisions.  All of these major projects will eventually
have a significant impact in terms of new job opportunities, local tax
revenues, tourist related businesses and new housing developments to name a
few.

Industry Restructuring

    Beginning around 1984 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
began a long process of changing the way the natural gas industry operates all
the way from the wellhead to the burnertip.  The change at the federal level
was gradual, beginning with very large customer access to the transportation
market in 1984 and leading to the complete withdrawal of the pipelines from
the merchant function in 1992.  The purpose of the change in FERC policy was
to promote competition in the market which was expected to produce savings to
the consumer.  Throughout this time the New York Public Service Commission
(PSC) and the gas utilities have worked together to adapt to a new
environment.
    In 1994 the PSC instituted a proceeding to address issues associated
with the restructuring of the emerging competitive natural gas market in New
York State.  As a result of this proceeding, Corning, as well as other gas
utilities in the state, filed tariffs which essentially allowed customers of
any size, including residential customers, access to the transportation
market.  In other words, all customers now have the ability to purchase their
gas requirements from a marketer rather than the gas utility.  Those that
choose to do so pay the utility for the use of their distribution system but
pay a marketer for the cost of the gas consumed.  Acceptance of this program
by both marketers and customers has been slow to catch on, primarily due to a
lack of profitability for marketers and savings for customers that are
generated at current levels.
    In 1997 the PSC instituted another proceeding designed to assess the
issues associated with the future of the natural gas industry and the role of
the local gas utility.  The staff of the PSC has made certain proposals which,
if instituted, will effectively separate the structure of the industry into
four distinct segments.  Under the proposed structure, production,
transportation, marketing and distribution will become distinct businesses. 
Gas utilities would no longer sell natural gas, they would merely provide the
distribution facilities to get gas to the burnertip.  The PSC staff proposal
indicates that this change should be complete within five years.
    Such a drastic change will obviously require much effort in working out
the details to ensure that customers are provided with the same safe, reliable
service that has historically been provided.  This company has taken the
position that it does not oppose this transition to a fully competitive market
but that it must be allowed to evolve naturally.  In order to minimize the
potential for unintended consequences which could have a negative effect on
the customer, arbitrary deadlines and regulations designed to accelerate the
process need to be avoided.  If, in fact, marketers can provide a more
economic product than the gas utility, customers will be quick to respond.
    Since gas utilities do not currently earn a profit from the sale of gas,
earnings derived from the use of the distribution facilities will tend to
remain neutral.  This company has effectively adapted to the changes to date
and, in fact, has been able to provide financial benefits to both customers
and shareholders as a result of some of the changes that have been instituted. 
Management is confident that the company will continue to successfully adapt
to the transition and will attempt to seek out new opportunities as we move
toward a fully competitive market.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
    The twelve months ended September 30, 1997 was the first full year completed
 by the Company since its change in fiscal year.  In 1996 the Company
 changed its fiscal year end from December 31 to September 30.  The adjacent
 table compares the operating results for the twelve months ended
 September 30, 1997 to the unaudited results for the twelve months ended
 September 30, 1996.  The discussion of operating results will focus on
 these periods.

738,074
Earnings per common share                   $       1.64        $       1.60

EARNINGS
    Consolidated net income amounted to $756,000 or $1.64 per share in 1997,
 compared to $738,000 or $1.60 per share in 1996.  Significant factors
 affecting the results of operations are discussed below.
OPERATING REVENUE
    Operating revenue of $17,836,000 declined nine percent in 1997 due
primarily to a reduction in gas cost billings.  The Company's billing rates
are adjusted to reflect changes in gas costs (which include current costs as
well as prior period deferred amounts) so that changes in these costs are
accompanied by corresponding changes in revenue and, therefore, have no impact
on the Company's earnings. 
    Also contributing to the reduction in operating revenue was a decline in
the volumes of gas delivered, due to milder weather.  Total gas delivered to
customers amounted to 7,897,615 Mcf in 1997 compared to 8,233,106 Mcf in 1996. 
However, the Company's weather normalization billing mechanism (briefly
discussed in note 1 to the financial statements) mitigates the impact of
weather on revenue.  As the result of a warmer 1997 the Company billed
$152,000 more than the previous year through this mechanism. 
    There were a couple items serving to increase the Company's operating
revenue.  Capacity assignment revenue increased $61,000 to $242,300 in 1997. 
This is derived from success in marketing the Company's unused pipeline
capacity and a regulatory incentive that allows the Company to retain 15
percent of the proceeds.  Additionally, a small revenue increase was achieved
through the implementation of a rate increase in the amount of $124,000 on
September 1, 1996.

OPERATING EXPENSE
    Purchase gas expense of $10,400,000 decreased 15% in 1997 due to lower
prior period deferred amounts and decreased deliveries noted above.  Also,
contributing to the decrease was a substantial benefit from the Company's lost
and unaccounted for gas incentive mechanism.  The Company was able to
capitalize on the incentive, realizing a benefit of $120,000 in 1997, a
considerable increase from $65,000 the previous year.  The Company experienced
an increase in operating and maintenance expenses in 1997 primarily due to
flood damage to the distribution system.  Additional expense was also incurred
in the area of leak detection and repair as well as increases in costs for
health insurance, pension expense and uniforms.
    Taxes other than federal income tax decreased nine percent due to a
reduction in gross revenue taxes resulting primarily from the gas cost billing
reduction noted previously.  The Company is subject to the New York public
utilities gross receipts tax which is levied on all revenue.   

UNREGULATED OPERATIONS
    The Appliance Corporation subsidiary earnings remained stable at
$221,900 in 1997 compared to $229,000 in 1996.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
    The Company utilized internally generated funds and short-term borrowing
to finance capital expenditures of approximately $1 million in 1997.  In
September, 1997 the Company completed a long-term debt issue in the form of a
twenty year senior note at 7.9 percent interest.  The Company utilized the
proceeds to retire a $1.6 million ten percent bond, and paid down $3.1 million
of short-term debt.
    The Company has unsecured bank lines of credit totaling $5,500,000, the
terms of which are disclosed in note 5 to the financial statements.  It is
expected that the Company's current capital resources will be sufficient for
1998 planned operations.

INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING
    The natural gas industry continues to change.  In 1997 the New York 

Public Service Commission instituted another proceeding designed to address 

the future of the industry.  A detailed discussion of industry restructuring 

appears on page 6 of this report.

YEAR 2000

    During 1997 the Company took steps to make its computer systems year 

2000 compliant.  This process is almost entirely complete, and the balance 

will be completed in 1998 at nominal cost.

CORNING NATURAL GAS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

For the Year Ended September 30, 1997
and the Nine Months Ended September 30, 1996


(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Corning Natural Gas Corporation (the Company) is a gas distribution company
 providing gas on a commodity and transportation basis to its customers in
 the Southern Tier of New York State.  The Company follows the Uniform
 System of Accounts prescribed by the Public Service Commission of the
 State of New York (PSC) which has jurisdiction over and sets rates for New
 York State gas distribution companies.  The Company's regulated operations
 meet the criteria and accordingly, follow the accounting and reporting of
 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71 (SFAS 71) "Accounting
 for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation.  The Company's financial
 statements contain the use of estimates and assumptions for reporting
 certain assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and actual results could
 differ from the estimates.  The more significant accounting policies are
 summarized below.


(a) Principles of Consolidation and Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly
 owned subsidiary, the Corning Natural Gas Appliance Corporation (Appliance
 Corporation).  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
 been eliminated in consolidation.  The results of the Appliance Corporation
 are reported separately as unregulated operations in the consolidated
 statements of income and retained earnings.  Shared expenses are allocated
 to the Appliance Corporation.

It is the Company's policy to reclassify amounts in the prior year's
 financial statements to conform with the current year's presentation.


(b) Utility Plant and Rented Gas Appliances

Utility plant is stated at the historical cost of construction.  These costs
include payroll, fringe benefits, materials and supplies, and transportation
costs.  The Company charges normal repairs to maintenance expense.  The
 Appliance Corporation capitalizes the cost of appliances and the original
 installation to rented gas appliances.  Subsequent repairs are expensed.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued

(c) Depreciation

The Company provides for depreciation for accounting purposes using a
 composite straight-line method based on the estimated economic lives of
 property.  The depreciation rate used for utility plant, expressed as an
 annual percentage of depreciable property, was 2.7% in 1997 and 1996.  At
 the time utility properties are retired, the original cost plus costs of
 removal less salvage, are charged to accumulated depreciation.

Rented gas appliances are depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates
 ranging from 10% to 20% per year.

(d) Revenue and Natural Gas Purchased

The Company records revenues from residential and commercial customers based
 on meters read on a cycle basis throughout each month, while certain large
 industrial and utility customers' meters are read through the end of each
 month.  The Company secured a weather normalization clause in the last
 major rate filing as protection against severe weather fluctuations.  This
 affects space heating customers and is activated when degree days are 2%
 greater or less than a 30 year average.  As a result, the effect on revenue
 fluctuations in weather related gas sales is somewhat neutralized.


Gas purchases are recorded based on readings of suppliers' meters as of the
 end of the month.  The Company's rate tariffs include a Gas Adjustment
 Clause (GAC) which adjusts rates to reflect changes in gas costs from
 levels established in the rate setting process.  In order to match such
 costs and revenue, the PSC has provided for an annual reconciliation of
 recoverable GAC costs with applicable revenue billed.  Any excess or
 deficiency in GAC revenue billed is deferred and the balance at the
 reconciliation date is either refunded to or recovered from customers over
 a subsequent 12 month period.

(e) Marketable Securities

Marketable securities, which are intended to fund the Company's supplemental
 pension plan, are classified as available for sale at September 30, 1997.
 Such securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices,
 with unrealized gains and losses, net of the related income tax effect,
 excluded from earnings, and reported as a separate component of
 stockholders' equity until realized.  The cost of securities sold was
 determined using the specific identification method.

The Company's regulated operations have no significant assets which are
 excluded from recoverability under rate filings.


(3) Regulatory Matters

Certain costs are deferred and recognized as expenses when they are
 reflected in rates and recovered from customers as permitted by SFAS 71.
 These costs are shown as Deferred Charges.  Such costs arise from the
 traditional cost-of-service rate setting approach whereby all prudently
 incurred costs are generally recoverable through rates.  Deferral of these
 costs is appropriate while the Company's rates are regulated under a
 cost-of-service approach.

In a purely competitive environment, such costs might not have been
 incurred or deferred.  Accordingly, if the Company's rate setting were
 changed from a cost-of-service approach and it was not longer allowed to
 defer these costs under SFAS 71, certain of these assets may not be fully
 recoverable.  However, the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, of
 competition and continues to operate in a cost-of-service based regulatory
 environment.  Accordingly, the Company believes that accounting under SFAS
 71 is still appropriate.

(3) Regulatory Matters, Continued

Below is a summarization of the Company's regulatory assets as of
 September 30, 1997 and 1996:

                                                      1997           1996

Unrecovered gas costs                       $    32,933                   -   
Deferred debits - accounting for income
    taxes                                                  1,016,661      1,016,

Other deferred debits                            434,770             584,809

Total - regulatory assets                   $    1,484,364      1,601,470

    Unrecovered gas costs    These costs are recoverable over future years and
 arise from an annual reconciliation of certain gas revenue and costs
 (as described in Note 1).

    Deferred debits - accounting  This amount represents the expected future
 recovery from for income taxes ratepayers of the tax consequences of
 temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis
 of assets and liabilities.

    Other deferred debits    The majority of this amount represents pension and
 postretirement benefit  costs in excess of the amounts currently
 recoverable through rates.  The PSC requires such excess costs to be
 deferred.

    The Company expects that its regulatory assets will be fully recoverable
 from customers.

(7) Pension Plan
Since 1990 the Company has been accruing a liability with respect to the
Supplemental Pension Plan for certain officers.  In 1997, the company estab-
lished a deferred compensation trust to provide for the future financing of
the plan.  The fair market value of assets in the trust was $641,899 at
September 30, 1997 and the plan liability, which is included in other
deferred credits on the balance sheet, was $554,000 and $444,000 at
September 30, 1997 and 1996 respectively.  The assets of the trust are
available to general creditors in the event of insolvency.

The Company has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of
 its employees.  The benefits are based on years of service and the
 employee's highest average compensation during a specified period.  The
 Company makes annual contributions to the plans equal to amounts determined
 in accordance with the funding requirements of the Employee Retirement
 Security Act of 1974.  Contributions are intended to provide not only for
 benefits attributed for service to date, but also for those expected to be
 earned in the future.

The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and amounts
 recognized on the Company's balance sheet under Statement of Financial
 Accounting Standards No. 87 (SFAS 87), Employers' Accounting for Pensions,
 at September 30, 1997 and 1996.

(7) Pension Plan, Continued

The components of net periodic pension expense under SFAS 87 for the year
 ended September 30, 1997 and the nine months ended September 30, 1996
 are as follows:

                                                      1997           1996

    period                                            $    217,401        154,71

0

For ratemaking purposes, pension expense represents the amount approved by
 the PSC in the Company's most recently approved rate case.  Pension
 expense for ratemaking purposes was approximately $39,000 for the year
 ended September 30, 1997 and for the nine months ended September 30, 1996
 there was a pension benefit of $45,000.  The difference between the pension
 expense (benefit) for ratemaking and financial statement purposes, and the
 amount computed under SFAS 87 has been deferred and is not included in
 the prepaid pension cost noted above.  Such balances equal $286,000 and
 $305,000 as of September 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

The assumptions used to determine the pension obligations and pension costs
 for 1997 and 1996 were 7.25% for weighted average discount rate, 5.0% for
 rate of compensation increase, and 8.0% for weighted average rate of
 return on plan assets.

(9) Postretirement Employee Benefits

In addition to the Company's defined benefit pension plans, the Company
 offers postretirement benefits to its employees who meet certain age and
 service criteria.  Currently, the retirees under age 65 pay 60% of their
 health care premium until Medicare benefits commence at age 65.  After age

 Company's rate case filings and financial reporting period, a regulatory
 asset has been recognized in the amount of approximately $26,000 to be
 recovered from ratepayers in the future.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


(9) Postretirement Employee Benefits, Continued

For measurement purposes, a 9% annual rate of increase in the per capita
 cost of covered benefits (health care cost trend rate) was assumed for
 1998.  The rate is assumed to decrease gradually to 6% by the year 2012
 and remain at that level thereafter.  A 1% increase in the actual health
 care cost trend would result in approximately a 3.0% increase in the
 service and interest cost components of the annual net periodic
 postretirement benefit cost and a 3.5% increase in the accumulated
 postretirement benefit obligation.  The weighted average discount rate used
 in determining the actuarial present value of the accumulated
 postretirement benefit obligation was 7.25%.


(10)     Commitments

The Company has agreements with seven pipeline companies providing for
 pipeline capacity for terms that extend through 2001.  These agreements
 require the payment of a demand charge for contracted capacity at Federal
 Energy Regulatory Commission approved rates.  Purchased gas costs incurred
 under these pipelines capacity agreements during 1997 and 1996 amounted
 to $3,363,429 and $3,139,258, respectively.  The Company also has
 short-term gas purchase agreements averaging three months in length, with
 prices to various indices.  The Company does not anticipate these agreements
 to be in excess of normal capacity requirements.

    A description of the executive officers, other than Mr. Thomas K. Barry,
 for whom a description is provided above, is set forth below.

    Kenneth J. Robinson (age 53) is Executive Vice President.  Mr. Robinson
 joined the Company in 1978 as an accountant.  Most recently he served as
 Financial Vice President and Treasurer for 4 years and in his current
 position for 6 years.
    
    Edgar F. Lewis (age 60) is Senior Vice President - Operations.  Mr. Lewis'
 career with the Company dates back to 1956.  He has been in charge of
 operations for the past 25 years; 17 years in his current position.

    Thomas S. Roye (age 44) is Vice President - Administration.  Mr. Roye has
 served 6 years in his current position and was previously Assistant
 Treasurer & Assistant Secretary.  He has prior utility experience and
 accounting education and has been employed since 1978.

    Gary K. Earley (age 43) is Treasurer.  Mr. Earley has been a practicing
 accountant since 1976.  He joined the firm in 1987 as an accountant in the
 rates and regulations department and has served as Treasurer for the past
 6 years.


    Phyllis J. Groeger (age 57) is Corporate Secretary.  Mrs. Groeger has been
 employed since 1973 in a number of positions advancing to Assistant
 Secretary in 1986 and has been Secretary of the Company for the past
 10 years.
    
    Compensation Pursuant to Plans.  The Company has entered into separate
 supplemental benefits agreements with Thomas K. Barry and one other
 executive officer (collectively, the "Supplemental Benefits Agreements"),
 which provide that the officer covered thereby and retiring after the age
 of 62 is entitled to receive monthly payments equal to 35% of such
 officer's monthly salary at retirement for either life or 180 months,
 whichever is longer.  Such amount payable shall increase by 4% annually on
 the anniversary date of such officer's retirement.  Retirement benefits
 otherwise available upon retirement at age 62 under the Supplemental Benefit
 Agreements are reduced cumulatively by 4% for each year prior to age 60 in
 which the covered officer retires; provided, however, that an officer
 covered under a Supplemental Benefits Agreement receives no retirement
 benefits thereunder in the event that such officer retires before age 55.
 Furthermore, the Supplemental Benefits Agreements provide that in the event
 that an officer covered by a Supplemental Benefits Agreement dies prior to
 retirement, such officer's designated beneficiary is entitled to receive
 monthly payments equal to 50% of such officer's monthly salary at death
 for 180 months.

    The Company has also entered into an additional, more limited, Supplemental
 Benefits Agreement with one other employee, which contains terms similar to
 the foregoing agreements.  However, such limited Supplemental Benefits
 Agreement provides for monthly payments equal to 20% of the subject
 employee's monthly salary in the event of retirement, monthly payments
 equal to 35% of his monthly salary in the event of his death prior to
 retirement, and does not include an annual escalator.

    Eligibility to enter into a Supplemental Benefits Agreement, or equivalent
 thereof, is based upon employee performance, service and value to the
 Company; such eligibility is determined on an individual basis by the Board
 of Directors.  Currently, Mr. Thomas K. Barry and two other executive
 officers (as discussed, above) are the only employees of the Company
 covered by a Supplemental Benefits Agreement, and no payments have been
 made to date under such agreements.  The Supplemental Benefits Agreements
 are in addition to the amounts shown in the Summary Compensation Table and
 are not subject to limitation.  As of September 30, 1997, the estimated
 annual benefits payable under a Supplemental Benefits Agreement upon
 retirement at the normal retirement age for Mr. Thomas K. Barry are $ 51,800.

    The Company also maintains the Corning Natural Gas Corporation Employees
 Savings Plan (the "Savings Plan").  All employees of the Company
 who work for more than 1,000 hours per year and who have completed one year
 of service may participate in the Savings Plan as of the following
 January 1 or July 1.  Under the Savings Plan, participants may contribute
 up to 15% of their wages.  For non-union employees, the Company will match
 one-half of the participant's contributions up to a total of 3% of the
 participant's wages.
 Company matching contributions vest in the participants account at a rate
 of 20% per year and become fully vested after five years.  All participants
 may select one of five investment plans, or a combination thereof, for their
 account.  Distribution of amounts accumulated under the Savings Plan occurs
 upon termination of employment or death of the participant.  The Savings
 Plan also contains loan and hardship withdrawal provisions.  During the
 fiscal year ended September 30, 1997 no amounts were distributed to executive
 officers under the Savings Plan.  Mr. Thomas K. Barry had $4,220 accrued
 to his account under the Savings Plan during said period.  This accrual is
 included in the figures appearing in the summary compensation table on page
 4.

    Compensation of Directors.  The current annual Director's compensation is
 $5,000.  In addition, Directors are paid $300 for each Board meeting
 attended. Additionally, the chairmen of the Board's Executive, Audit,
 Compensation and Pension Fund committees and those directors who serve on
 more than one committee receive an annual fee of $1,500 for such services.
 Committee members other than the chairmen are paid $1,000 annually for
 their services, subject to the limitation that no committee chairman or
 member may receive  than $1,500 annually for such services regardless of
 the number of committees on which he serves.

    As allowed by New York law, the Company currently has in effect an
 insurance policy, with an effective date of June 1, 1997, with National
 Union Fire Insurance Company for the indemnification of officers and
 directors at an annual premium cost of $ 43,000.

    Employment Contracts and Termination of Employment and Change-in-Control
 Arrangements.  In January of 1992, the Company entered into an employment
 contract with its President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Thomas K.
 Barry. Under the terms of such employment contract, Mr. Barry is
 compensated for his duties as an officer and director with such salary as
 is determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.  The term of Mr.
 Barry's employment contract is five years, unless earlier terminated by an
 act of either the Company or Mr. Barry.  Beginning in 1994, however, Mr.
 Barry's employment contract is automatically extended for an additional
 one-year period.  Mr. Barry's employment contract further provides that
 upon any change in control of the Company leading to the termination of
 Mr. Barry's employment with the Company, the Company shall pay Mr. Barry
 three times his then-present annual salary, or such lesser amount as may
 be required to comply with certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.

    Selection of Auditors.  KPMG Peat Marwick, Certified Public Accountants of
 Rochester, New York, have been selected as auditors for the Company for
 the ensuing year.  KPMG Peat Marwick, who served as principal accountants
 for the Company for the past fiscal year, have no direct or indirect
 financial interest in the Company or its subsidiaries in the capacity of
 promoter, underwriter, voting director, officer or employee.  A
 representative of KPMG Peat Marwick will be present at the meeting, with
 the opportunity to make a statement if such representative desires to do
 so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

    Other Matters.  Except for the matters set forth above, the Board of
 Directors knows of no matters which may be presented to the meeting, but
 if any other matters properly come before the meeting, it is the intention
 of the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy to vote such proxy
 in accordance with their judgment in such matters.

PLEASE DATE, SIGN AND RETURN THE ENCLOSED PROXY.

                                       By Order of the Board of Directors,
