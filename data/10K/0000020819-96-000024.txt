Item 1	Business

The Registrant's operations are presently conducted through its Precision
 Instrument Division located in Monrovia, California. The product presently
 being produced by the Precision Instrument Division consist  of a line of
 uninterruptible power supplies (U.P.S.) ranging in size from 400va to 37.5 kva.
 The U.P.S.  is a power system that can both smooth out voltage fluctuations
 and maintain a power load under power blackout conditions. U.P.S.'s are
 designed to provided fifteen minutes or more(depending on num

The registrant markets the U.P.S. trough trade publications, tradeshows and
 telemarketing. However, sales are generally made by the Registrant through
 distributors who sell the products to end-users. For the year 1995,
 Nova Power System, a major distributor through its direct and indirect sales
 accounted for more than twenty percent of the Registrant's total sales.

The Registrant assembles finished components and other materials to produce
 its products. Relatively little fabrication or raw materials is done by the
 Registrant. The Registrant purchases imported raw material and finished
 components used in production of the Registrant's products.  Thus, the
 Registrant is dependent upon the ability of suppliers to meet performance
 specifications, quality standard and delivery schedules. The Registrant
 endeavors to assure availability of sources of supplies and does not an

Competition - The markets for the registrant's products highly competitive.
 The  Registrant is aware of approximately forty competitors for on-line UPS
 products and additional fifty to sixty competitors for off-line UPS products.
 Many of these companies have far greater financial resources than the
 registrant. The Registrant competes primarily on the basis of the quality,
 reliability and technical sophistication of its products, although price
 remains an important factor. The registrant attempts to locates 

Substantially all of the Registrant's products are subject of ongoing
 modification and I improvment and are subject to scientific and technological
 changes.

Item 3.	Legal Proceedings

In 1996 the company entered into a verbal distribution agreement granting a
 distributor the non-exclusive rights to distributor certain products of its
 former CAD division. In 1991, the company filed suit to recover the
 uncollected balance of its receivable due from the distributor.
 The distributor filed a countersuit alleging misrepresentation.
 On May 24,1993 the jury awarded the distributor net damages of approximately
 $264,000
including double damages, legal cost and interest. In November 1993. the
 Company filed  and appeal against this judgment and provided a supersedeas
 bond secured by $300,000 certificate of deposit. On November 8,1994, the
 Court of Appeals issued an order reversing the trial courts judgment against
 the Company. On January 23,1995 the distributor files an Application for
 Writ of Error with the Supreme Court of Texas.
On July 7,1995, the Supreme Court of Texas ordered the judgment of the Court
 of appeals be reversed and the cause be remanded back to that court for
 further proceedings. On July 20,1995, the company filed a motion for
 Rehearing with the Supreme Court. Management has estimated a range of
 amounts for the potential loss, including legal costs, relating to this
 matter and an amount considering management to be the probable loss was
 provided for in the statement of operations for 1993 as loss from discontinued
 operations. An unfavorable resolution of this matter to the company could 
result in an additional liability of approximately $250,000 which jas not been
reflected in the financial statements.

The company's operations are In manufacturing of uninterruptible power
 systems and related products. A summary of the Company's significant
 accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the financial
 statements to follows

USE OF ESTIMATES:
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
 accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
 that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
 contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments which are
 readily convertible into cash.

INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost(including direct materials,
 direct labor and manufacturing overhead) or market on the first-in, first-out
 basis. Obsolete and possible excess quantities are reduced to their estimated
 net realizable values in the period such obsolescence is determined. 

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

NOTE 5- TAXES ON INCOME
In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
 of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes"
("SFAS109").The Company previously accounted for income taxes under Accounting
 Principles Board Opinion No. 11("APB 11"). Effective January 1,1996 the Company
  changed its method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method
 required under APB 11 to the asset end liability method required under SFAS
 109. There was no effect of this change on the Company's financial position or
 results of operations  due to cumulative losses. 
The objective of the asset and liability method is to establish deferred tax
 assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial
 reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities at
 enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or
 settled. As of December 31,1995, the Company has total deferred tax liability
 of $13,000, and total deferred tax assets of $546,000. The Company has recorded
 valuation allowance for the amount by which total deferred tax assets exceed 
total deferred liability,and as a result, the Company has not recorded any 
liability or assets for deferred taxes as of December 31,1995. Significant
components of the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of
December 31,1995,are as follows:

Deferred tax assets
	Allowance for doubtful accounts		              	$   6,000
	Inventory reserve					                              7,000
	Accrued legal fees					                            22,000

								                                           485,000
	Valuation  allowance					                         472,000
								                                      ============

 distributor the non-exclusive rights to distribute certain products of its
 former CAD division. In 1991, the Company filed suit to recover the uncollected
 balances of its receivable due from the distributor. The distributor filed a
 countersuit  alleging mis representation. On may 24,1993 the jury awarded the
 distributor net damages of approximately $265,000 including double damages,
 legal costs and interest. In November 1993, the Company filed an appeal againts
this judgement and provided a supersedeas bond secured by $300,000 certificate
of deposit, which has been classified as a current asset in the accompanying
balance sheet. On November 8,1994 the Courts of Appeals issued an order
 reversing the trial courts judgment against the company.On January 23,1995
the distributor filedan Application for Writ of Error with the Supreme Court
of Texas. On July 7,1995,the Supreme Court of Texas ordered the judgement
of the Court of Appeals be reversed and the cause be remanded back to that
court for further proceeding. On July 20,1995,the company filed a Motion for
Rehearing with the Supreme Court.
Management has estimated a range of amounts for the potential loss,including
legal costs, relating to this matter and an amount considered by management
to be probable loss was provided for in the statement of operations for 1993
as loss form discontinued operations.The additional liability, if any, and the
classification of the certificate of deposit cannot presently be determined.
A unfavorable resolution of this matter to the Company, including failure to
conclude the appeal prior to December 31,1996 could result in an additional
liability of approximately $250,000 and/or the reclasification  of an equal
amount of the "cash restricted" to noncurrent assets,which has not been 
reflected in the financial statements.
