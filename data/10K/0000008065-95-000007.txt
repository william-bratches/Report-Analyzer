                            PART I

Item 1.   Description of Business

     (a)  Business Development.  Astrosystems, Inc. ("Registrant"
or "Company") designs and manufactures power conversion devices
and electronic products for measurement and display.  The
Company's Industrial Products Division produces electronic and
electromechanical devices for precision motion measurement and
control.  A wholly owned subsidiary, Behlman Electronics, Inc.,
produces commercial AC power sources.  

         The Company's subsidiary, AstroPower, Inc., is engaged
in the development of a new process for manufacturing low cost,
thin film polycrystalline solar cells for the direct conversion
of sunlight into electricity.  The Company currently owns 32.3%
of the common stock of AstroPower, Inc.  Assuming certain
convertible preferred stock is converted to common stock, the
Company's interest in AstroPower could be reduced to 22.8%.  

         Registrant is a corporation originally incorporated in
the State of New York in 1959.  In April, 1987 Registrant changed
its state of incorporation to Delaware.

     (b)  Business of Issuer.

          (1)  Principal Products.  Reference is made to Item
1(a) above.

          (2)  Distribution Methods.  Defense products are
marketed by the Company's Program Managers and other management
personnel.  Commercial products are marketed by the Company's
Regional Sales Managers, manufacturer's representatives, and
in some cases, non-exclusive distributors.  

          (3)  New Product Development.  Inapplicable.

          (4)  Competition.  In the marketing of its electronic
and electromechanical products, Registrant estimates that it 
competes regularly with approximately fifteen companies and, on
an irregular basis, with a much larger number of companies. 
Competition in these fields depends on such factors as price,
product reliability and performance, engineering and production. 
In particular, due primarily to budgetary restraints and program
cutbacks, competition in the Company's government markets has
been increasingly severe and price has become the major
overriding factor in contract and subcontract awards.  To the
best of Registrant's knowledge, some of its regular competitors
are much larger companies with substantially greater capital
resources and far larger engineering, administrative, sales, and
production staffs.  Registrant does not believe that it is a
significant factor in any of its markets.

          In the field of photovoltaic solar cells (see Item 1(a)
above), Registrant's subsidiary, AstroPower, Inc., competes with
established manufacturers, as well as with other sources of
energy and the companies involved therewith.  In addition, a
number of larger concerns, including major oil companies, have
already entered or are expected to enter this field, all of which
have considerably greater financial, marketing and technological
strengths than Registrant.  A number of smaller concerns are also
actively pursuing this market.

          (5)  Sources of Supply.  Registrant designs and
assembles substantially all of its products.  It purchases parts
and components, however, from widely diversified sources, and at
times it has employed subcontractors to fabricate portions of its
products.  The Registrant is not materially dependent on any one
supplier for such items and Management believes that, barring any
unusual shortages or economic conditions, it could develop
alternate suppliers for such items.

          (6)  Customers.  During the year ended June 30, 1995,
approximately 8% of Registrant's sales were made directly to
government agencies as prime contractors, 46% were made to other
manufacturers as a subcontractor pursuant to government contracts
and 46% were made to commercial users.  The following table sets
forth the approximate extent to which Registrant's sales were
made to military or commercial customers (and in the case of
military sales, whether made by Registrant as prime contractor
or subcontractor) for each of the fiscal years ended June 30,
1994 and June 30, 1995.

Fiscal            Military Sales         Commercial   Total
 Year   Prime Contractor  Subcontractor   Sales (1)   Sales

1994    $2,394,000        $6,525,000     $4,498,000   $13,417,000
1995       992,000         5,658,000      5,669,000    12,319,000

          (1)  Commercial sales are primarily catalog items sold
to other manufacturers.  For Behlman sales, these manufacturers
include defense contractors who may use such goods for test of
military products.

          During the year ended June 30, 1995, General Motors
Hughes Aircraft Corporation accounted for approximately 43% of
gross sales.  Production orders for this customer are scheduled
for completion in October 1995.

          (7)  Patents, Trademarks and Licenses.   The Company's
subsidiary, AstroPower Inc., has been assigned 7 patents that
cover various aspects of its continuing solar cell development
activities.  In 1983, the Company acquired a 16 year license from
the University of Delaware covering a new process for the
manufacture of solar cells and has exclusively sublicensed the
patents and technology to AstroPower Inc. (see Note D[4] to the
Financial Statements).  Effective December 1993, the term of the
license agreement was extended to 2006.


          (8)  Government Approval.   Inapplicable.

          (9)  Special Features of Government Contracts.  The
extensive involvement of Registrant in government-related defense
contracts subjects Registrant to several potentially adverse
factors affecting defense contractors in general.

          As noted above, approximately 54% of Registrant's sales
during the year ended June 30, 1995 were related, directly or
indirectly, to government defense programs, and any substantial
 overall reduction in defense expenditures adversely affects the
business of Registrant.

          Orders under government prime or subcontracts are
customarily subject to termination at the convenience of the
government, in which event the contractor is normally entitled to
reimbursement for allowable costs and a reasonable allowance for
profits unless the termination of a contract was due to a default
on the part of the contractor.  During the fiscal years ended
June 30, 1995 and June 30, 1994, no government prime contracts
were cancelled. 

          (10) Research and Development.  For the years ended
June 30, 1995 and 1994, the amounts expended for research and
development were not material.    

          (11) Environmental Regulation Compliance.  Registrant
is of the belief that compliance with Federal, state and local
provisions which may have been enacted or adopted regulating the
discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise
relating to the protection of the environment, will have no
material effect upon its capital expenditures, earnings and
competitive position.

          (12) Number of Employees.  Registrant currently has 113
full time employees.  Management believes its relations with its
employees are good.  No employees are represented by a collective
bargaining agreement.

Item 2.   Description of Property.

          Registrant's principal executive offices and
 engineering, manufacturing and testing facilities are located in
Lake Success, Long Island, New York, where Registrant occupies
approximately 46,550 square feet of usable space.  The premises
are leased from an unaffiliated party through August 31, 1996
(cancelable upon ninety days notice) at an annual rental of
approximately $505,000, which includes common area maintenance,
plus real estate taxes of approximately $143,000 (at 1995 rates).

          Registrant's subsidiary, Behlman Electronics, Inc.,
leases space in Ventura, California at an annual rental of
$13,300.  The lease expires December 31, 1995.


          Registrant's subsidiary, AstroPower, Inc., leases
40,000 square feet of space from the University of Delaware under
a 20 year lease starting July 1, 1991.  Current lease payments
are $178,000 per year.

Item 3.   Legal Proceedings.

          There are no material pending legal proceedings to
which Registrant or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of
which any of their property is the subject.

Item 4.   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

          There were no matters submitted to a vote of security
holders during the three month period ended June 30, 1995.

Item 5.   Market for Common Stock and Related Stockholder
          Matters.

     (a)  Registrant's Common Stock is traded in the over-the-
counter market (NASDAQ symbol:  ASTR).  The following table sets
forth the quarterly high and low bid prices for the last two
fiscal years, as reported by the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc.  The quotations set forth below
represent interdealer quotations (which exclude retail markups,
markdowns and commissions) and do not necessarily reflect actual
transactions.


                                                    Bid
               Quarterly Period              High        Low

          July 1993 - September 1993         4 11/16     4 1/8
          October 1993 - December 1993       4 1/2       3 7/8
          January 1994 - March 1994          5 1/4       4 
          April 1994 - June 1994             4 5/8       4 1/8
          July 1994 - September 1994         4 5/8       4 1/8
          October 1994 - December 1994       4 3/8       3 7/8
          January 1995 - March 1995          4 5/16      3 7/8
          April 1995 - June 1995             5 3/8       4 



     (b)  The number of stockholders of record of the
Registrant's Common Stock, par value $.10 per share, as of June
30, 1995 was 1,055.

     (c)  Registrant has not paid any cash dividends since its
inception in 1959.  Any decision as to the future payment of
dividends will depend on the future financial requirements of
Registrant.

Item 6.   Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of
          Operation.

          Liquidity, Capital Resources and Impact of Inflation

          Cash and Cash Equivalents, plus Marketable Securities,
and U.S. Treasury Notes increased from $33,306,000 to $34,779,000
since the beginning of the fiscal year.  This increase was
primarily due to increased interest on investments.

          Accounts Receivable - Claims are the estimated billings
associated with terminations and changes on government contracts
and subcontracts.  These receivables normally require a period of
negotiation before a final price is established.
     
          The Company announced on October 23, 1992 a Board of
Directors authorization for the repurchase of up to 500,000
shares of Common Stock to be made from time to time through open
market and privately negotiated transactions.  Since that time
408,727 shares have been repurchased.  The Company did not
repurchase any of its Common Stock for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1995.

          Inflation has not materially impacted the operations of
the Company.

          Results of Operations 

          Comparison of Fiscal 1995 vs Fiscal 1994 - The
Company's sales for the year ended June 30, 1995 declined from
the prior equivalent period by $1,098,000 or 8.2%.  Defense
Electronics Sales had an expected substantial decline which was
partly offset by a 48.5% increase in Behlman Electronics sales. 
Industrial Automation sales also declined.

          Defense Electronics sales are expected to continue to
decrease due to the current defense procurement environment with
its declining budgets and resulting fierce price competition. 
Production deliveries of ADCAP Torpedo Power Supplies, which were
the Company's major defense product, have been completed.  The
Company is attempting to offset a decline in Defense Electronics
revenue by increased commercial sales for Industrial Automation
Products and Behlman Electronics.  In addition, the Company is
seeking niche Defense Electronics markets such as repair and
maintenance of the Company's products as well as products of
other manufacturers.  Behlman Electronics during fiscal 1995
accomplished a major increase in revenue.  However, there is no
assurance that the Company's strategy will be successful in the
long run and the Company anticipates a further substantial
decrease in total sales during fiscal 1996.

          Cost of Sales as a percentage of revenue for the year
ended June 30, 1995 was 72.3% of revenue versus 69.9% for the
prior equivalent period.  The Company's Cost of Sales includes
fixed expenses such as rent; in addition, the Company's
Government contracts and subcontracts require certain expenses
such as quality assurance personnel, which cannot be reduced in
proportion to revenue.  Therefore, unless the Company can reverse
its revenue decline, the long term Cost of Sales percentage will
increase.

          Selling, General and Administrative Expenses did not
decrease in proportion to revenue due to certain fixed expenses
which could not be reduced, as well as the necessity to maintain
the Company's sales and marketing force.

          Investment income for the comparative periods is shown
below:
 
                                Fiscal Year Ended June 30,
                                1995               1994   
Interest & Dividend Income      $1,700,000         $1,205,000
(Loss) on Securities               (52,000)          (217,000)
                                __________         __________
Investment Income               $1,648,000         $  988,000
                                 =========            =======

Interest and Dividend Income increased due to higher interest
rates on invested funds.  The Loss on Securities in Fiscal Year
1995 was primarily due to a realized loss in a U.S. Treasury
mutual fund; the loss in Fiscal Year 1994 was primarily due to an
unrealized loss on the same U.S. Treasury mutual fund.

     Income taxes for the year ended June 30, 1995 were
approximately 28% of pretax income which is lower than the
Federal statutory rate of 34% principally due to a change in
New York State tax law permitting utilization of net operating
loss carryforwards in computing New York State franchise tax
under the minimum taxable income base, which resulted in
subjecting the Company's income to New York State franchise tax
under the entire net income base.

     Income tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 1994 included
$392,000 from the reversal of a tax reserve no longer required.

     Net earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995 were
$623,000 or $.13 per share.
     
     Net earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30 ,1994 were
$1,135,000 or $.22 per share which includes $404,000 or $.08 per
share from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle relating to accounting for income taxes (SFAS No. 109)
and $392,000 or $.07 per share relating  to the effect of the
reversal of income tax reserves no longer required.

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


Board of Directors and Shareholders
Astrosystems, Inc.
Lake Success, New York

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Astrosystems, Inc. and subsidiaries as at June 30, 1995 and
June 30, 1994, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the years then ended.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements enumerated above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Astrosystems, Inc. and subsidiaries as at
June 30, 1995 and June 30, 1994, and the results of their
operations and cash flows for each of the years then ended in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                ASTROSYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(NOTE A) - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

      [1]  Principles of consolidation:

           The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  Material
inter-company transactions and account balances have been
eliminated in consolidation.

      [2]  Statement of cash flows:

           For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the
Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased
with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

      [3]  Marketable securities:

           In July 1994, the Company adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 "Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (SFAS
115).  This standard requires the Company to classify its
investments as held-to-maturity, available for sale, or trading. 
The Company classifies all of its securities as held-to-maturity
which are carried at amortized cost.  The adoption of SFAS 115
had no significant impact on the Company's financial statements
at June 30, 1995.  At June 30, 1995 marketable securities
consisted of U.S. Treasury obligations, of which $8,680,000 is
current, and $12,980,000 matures through 1998.

      [4]  Inventories:

           Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out) or market.

      [5]  Factory, laboratory, and other equipment:

           Equipment is depreciated over estimated useful lives
of 3 to 8 years, computed primarily on the straight-line method.

           Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-
line method over the life of the improvement, or the term of the
lease, whichever is shorter.

      [6]  Revenue and revenue recognition:

           The Company is engaged in the manufacture and sale of 
electronic and electromechanical devices for measurement,
display, control and power input.  The Company records its sales
when the manufacturing process is substantially complete, and,
accordingly, accrues all additional costs required to complete
the units.


           The Company's warranty on commercial sales is normally
90 days except for certain products and customers where the 
warranty is one year.  The warranty provisions on military sales
are normally negotiated for each major contract.  Warranty
expense has been minimal in recent years.

      [7]  Excess of cost over the fair value of net assets
           acquired:

           The excess of cost over the fair value of net assets
acquired is being amortized on a straight line basis over ten
years.

      [8]  Income taxes:

           The Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes, effective as of July 1, 1993, to comply with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109
(SFAS 109), "Accounting for Income Taxes."  Deferred income taxes
are based on the liability method as prescribed by SFAS 109,
which requires an adjustment to the deferred tax liability to
reflect income tax rates currently in effect rather than
historical rates.  When income tax rates increase or decrease, a
corresponding adjustment to income tax expense is recorded
currently by applying the rate change to the cumulative temporary
differences.  The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 109 through
June 30, 1993 was $404,000, which is included in the accompanying
Statement of Operations for the year ended June 30, 1994.

(NOTE B) - Inventories:

      Inventories comprise the following:
                                                June 30,
                                            1995        1994

           Raw material                 $1,762,000   $2,100,000
           Work in process               1,766,000    2,518,000
                                         _________    _________
               TOTAL                    $3,528,000   $4,618,000
                                         =========    =========

           Work in process includes materials, labor, and
manufacturing overhead.

(NOTE C) - Marketable Securities:

           At June 30, 1995 and June 30, 1994 marketable
securities included in current assets had a cost of $8,680,000
and $10,637,000, respectively (which includes U.S. Treasury
obligations at a cost of $8,680,000 and $7,989,000,
respectively).

(NOTE D) - Contingencies and Commitments:

      [1]  The Company has a profit-sharing plan which provides
benefits upon retirement, death, incapacity or separation of
eligible employees. There was no profit-sharing expense for the
years ended June 30, 1995 and June 30, 1994.

      [2]  The Company has a Retirement Savings Plan which allows
participants to make contributions by salary reduction pursuant
to section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  The
Company is obligated to make  contributions (either in cash or
Company stock) equal to 50% of the employees' contribution.  The
Company's contributions to the plan for the years ended June 30,
1995 and June 30, 1994 consisted of the Company's common stock
which it valued at $136,000 and $135,000, respectively. 
Employees vest immediately in their contribution and in the
Company's contribution.

      [3]  The Company and its three principal officers are
parties to a stock retirement agreement which requires the
Company, upon the death of any of these officers, to purchase
30% of his holdings of the Company's common stock at a price
equal to the greater of the average market price over the last
six months or the book value.  The Company has life insurance
policies on the lives of the aforementioned officers to fund
substantially all of its obligations in the event of their death.

      [4]  In 1983, the Company acquired a 16-year license from
the University of Delaware covering a new  process for the
manufacture of solar cells.  In connection with the acquisition
of the aforementioned license, the Company issued a $20,000,000
nonrecourse note originally due in 1993 and bearing interest at
14% per year.  The note is secured by the Company's rights under
the license and is to be paid prior to its due date solely on the
basis of 4% of sales of products developed by this process,
subject to certain minimum quarterly payments of $11,250 to
$12,500.  An amendment to the License Agreement extended the term
of the license agreement to 2006 as well as extended the due date
of the note to May 1999.  As consideration for the amendment, the
Company paid $115,000 in cash, which was charged to operations
for the year ended June 30, 1994, and transferred 35,000 shares
of stock in its investment in AstroPower, Inc.  For the year
ended June 30, 1995, the Company paid $34,000 in quarterly
payments.  The Company, for financial reporting purposes, has not
recorded the note and will charge operations with any payments. 
No payments based on sales were required to be made through June
30, 1995.  To the extent that any lump-sum payment is made, the
license cost would be amortized from that date forward, thus
matching the cost of the license against sales from that date
forward.  (See Note E).

      [5]  The Company is obligated for minimum annual rentals
under leases for office and factory space expiring in fiscal 1997
as follows:

           Year ending 
             June 30, 
               1996                                      352,000
               1997                                       58,000
                                                         _______
                 TOTAL                                  $410,000
                                                         =======

           The terms of the leases include escalation clauses for
increases in real estate taxes and certain operating expenses. 
Total rent expense aggregated $527,000 and $505,000 for the years
ended June 30, 1995 and June 30, 1994, respectively.  In August
1995, the Company extended its Lake Success lease through August
31, 1996, cancelable upon ninety days notice.

      [6]  Employment contracts with the officers of the Company,
which may be terminated by the Company on not less than three
years prior notice, provide for minimum annual total compensation
of approximately $748,000.  In the event of death or disability
of the Company's principal officers while employed, the contracts
call for payments of 50% of compensation paid in the preceding
fiscal year for the three years following such event. 

      [7]  Concentration of Credit Risk:  Most of the Company's
customers are large prime contractors with the U.S. Government or
various departments and agencies of the U.S.  Government (see
Note I[1]).

           The Company  maintains its operating cash account at
one bank.  Other cash and cash equivalents are held in dollar
denominated mutual funds which invest in United States Treasury
obligations.  

           Marketable securities are United States Treasury
obligations.

(NOTE E) - Long-term Investments:

           The Company owned 81% of a subsidiary corporation, 
ASI Solar Energy Corporation, which was liquidated in June 1994. 
That corporation's major asset was an investment in AstroPower,
Inc., which was distributed as part of the liquidation.  The
Company, as a result of this transaction and the transfer of
AstroPower, Inc. shares described in Note D[4], owns 32.3% of the
common stock of AstroPower, Inc.  Assuming certain convertible
preferred stock is converted to common stock, Astrosystems'
interest in AstroPower, Inc. would be reduced to 22.8%.  Such
investment was accounted for on the equity method and,
accordingly, the Company recorded its share in the losses of this
entity as a reduction of its investment.  This investment was
fully written down to zero in prior years.

           The long-term investment shown on the accompanying
balance sheets represents an investment in a venture capital
limited partnership.  The estimated fair value of the investment
at June 30, 1995 is at least equal to the carrying value.

(NOTE F) - Stock Options

           The Company's 1981 Stock Option Plan provided for the
granting of options to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of its
common stock to eligible employees and non-employee directors. 
Such plan expired in April 1991.

           The Company's 1991 Stock Option Plan provides for the
granting of options to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of its
common stock to eligible employees, non- employee directors,
consultants and advisors.

           A summary of stock option activity related to the
Company's stock option plans is as follows:

           During the years ended June 30, 1995 and June 30,
1994, 150,000 and 24,500 stock options, respectively, were
extended.  The extended options are considered to have been
granted pursuant to the 1991 Stock Option Plan.  A charge was
made to operations for approximately $184,000 and $40,000
respectively, which represents the difference between the option
price and the market value at the time of their extension.  

           As at June 30, 1995, options for the purchase of
378,213 shares were available for future grant.

The deferred tax liability  at June 30, 1995 is as follows:

Deferred tax liability:
  Difference between financial reporting and tax 
    bases of University of Delaware license and
    related note (see Note D[4])                     $11,419,000

           Deferred tax expense results from temporary
differences in the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and
financial reporting purposes.  The principal sources of these
differences were amortization and accrued interest referred to in
Note D[4], the tax effect of which was $240,000 and $500,000 for
the years ended June 30, 1995 and June 30, 1994, respectively.

           At June 30, 1995, the Company had available net
operating loss carryforwards for income tax reporting purposes as
