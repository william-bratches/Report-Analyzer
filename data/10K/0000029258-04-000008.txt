ITEM 5.	MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS;
ITEM 6.	MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATIONS;
ITEM 7.	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Items 5, 6 and 7 are set forth on Page 15, Pages 1through 2 and Pages 6
through 14, respectively, of Exhibit 13, the Annual Report to
Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2003, which report is
incorporated herein by reference.


ITEM 8.	CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING
            AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

There have been no disagreements between the Company and its independent
auditors on any matter of accounting principles or practices or financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure since the Company's
inception of a nature which, if not resolved, would have caused the
accountant to make reference in connection with its report.  On
October 13, 2003, Dwyer & Company, CPA, PC, our independent accountant,
resigned, when the review for the period ending September 30, 2003 was
completed.  On February 23, 2004, we engaged Anderson ZurMuehlen & Co.,
P.C. as our principal accountant to audit our financial statements.  The
decision to change was approved by the Board of Directors.  Dwyer &
Company, CPA, PC's  report on the financial statements for either of the
past two years did not contain an adverse opinion and was not modified as
to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.  A current report
on Form 8-K was filed with the SEC on February 24, 2004 regarding the
change in auditors.


ITEM 8A.	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

	Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on an
evaluation carried out under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer during the 90-day period prior to the filing
of this report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
believe that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14, are, to the best of
their knowledge, effective.

Changes in internal controls, subsequent to the date of this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are not aware of
any significant changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting, including any corrective actions with regard to significant
deficiencies and material weakness, or in other factors that could
significantly affect these controls to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us, in reports that we file or submit under the
Securities Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time period specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules or
regulations.

There has been no audit committee established.  The Board of Directors did
not deem an audit committee necessary due to the small size of the Company,
the fact that 88.2% of the Company's assets are in cash and due to the fact
that Diversified Realty, Inc. is not publicly traded or listed on any
securities exchange.

Based solely on its review of reports of persons subject to Section 16 of
the Securities and Exchange Act, the Company believes that required reports
were filed in a timely manner disclosing transactions involving the

DIVERSIFIED REALTY, INC.
ANNUAL REPORT

DESCRIPTION AND LINES OF BUSINESS

Diversified Realty, Inc. (herein referred to as the
"Company") is a majority-owned subsidiary of M Corp,
a financial holding company. As of December 31, 2003,
M Corp owned approximately ninety-five percent of the
outstanding common stock of the Company.

The Company was formed as a Montana corporation on
December 23, 1957 as "Prudential Diversified Services"
and from 1963 to 1966 was involved in a Chapter X
bankruptcy and reorganization proceeding.  From the plan
of reorganization adopted by the United States District
Court, creditors and holders of outstanding debentures
were given the right to tender and convert to common stock
of Diversified Realty, Inc. by December 30, 1972.
Currently, Diversified Realty, Inc. is primarily engaged
in the ownership and rental of 10 units of real property
located exclusively in Yellowstone County, Montana.  The
units have an average occupancy rate of 16 people.  The
Company owns one property, not operated as a rental,
located in Clearwater, Florida which is currently listed
for sale with Caldwell Banker.

Information as of December 31, 2003, concerning the gross
carrying amount of real property, accumulated depreciation
and encumbrances on a property by property basis is presented
in Note 4, Investments in Real Estate, of the Notes to
Financial Statements.  The Company does not own any one
property which is equal to 10% or more of the Company's total
assets and believes that all real property is adequately
insured against loss.  The Company does not rely on just one
or two tenants for its income.  All lease agreements are
short term, expiring more than once per year.  The Company
employed three part time persons in 2003.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Income decreased $66,255, 191.7%, in 2003 as compared with
2002. The decrease in net income in 2003 as compared with 2002
was due primarily to an increase in legal and accounting expenses
and a decrease in dividend and interest revenue during 2003.

Dividend and interest income decreased $9,342, 35.9%, in 2003 as
compared with 2002. The decrease in dividend and interest income
in 2003 as compared with 2002 was due to a decrease in rates
earned by the Company.

ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued

Total operating expenses increased $43,696, 60.6%, in 2003 as
compared with 2002.  Other expenses increased $30,415, 54%, in
2003 as compared with 2002 due to increases in operating costs,
mainly professional fees.

Income tax expense increased $13,186, 121.5%, in 2003 as compared
with 2002 due to the increase in deferred tax items as noted in
Note 5. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return
with the Company's parent company and other affiliates.

The Company has spent a great deal of time and effort planning and
filing a Schedule 13e-3 and a Schedule 13e-3/A with the Securities
Exchange Commission in order to merge with DRI, Inc., a  company
formed November 10, 2003.  The purpose of the merger is to provide
a source of liquidity to the unaffiliated security holders and to
enable the Company to eliminate the burdensome time, expenses and
costs associated with operating a public company.

Transactions with the Company's parent company and its affiliates
during 2003 and 2002 are disclosed in Note 6, Related Party
Transactions, of the Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company is considering acquisitions that would deplete the
Company's available cash and thus affect the liquidity of the
Company. The acquisition is discussed in Note 7 to the Financial
Statements.

free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Nature of Operations, Risks and Uncertainties

The Company is engaged in the ownership and rental of ten
properties located exclusively within Yellowstone County,
Montana. The Company's rental operations are dependent in
large part upon the economy and rental conditions within
Yellowstone County, Montana. The Company leases its
properties to lessees with terms of less than one year.

The process of preparing financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of certain types of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Such estimates primarily
relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date
of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

(b)	Depreciation

Depreciation for the various classifications of rental property,
plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line and
accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the
assets as follows:

Buildings						15 - 27 Years
Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment	       3 - 10 Years

(c)	Income Taxes

The Company files a consolidated income tax return with its parent
company. Income taxes are allocated to the Company based upon the
ratio of the Company's pre-tax income to total consolidated pre-tax
income.  The Company follows the practice of recording deferred
income taxes resulting from timing differences between financial
reporting and income tax reporting.

(d)	Policy of Cash Equivalents

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents
include time deposits, certificates of deposit and money market
accounts, all with original maturities of three months or less.

(e) Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income includes the difference between the total net
unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities at December 31,
2003 and the deferred income taxes applicable to the net unrealized
gain.

1.	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -(continued)

(f) Retirement Plans

The Company adopted an employees' savings plan under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") during 1998. The Company
allows eligible employees to contribute the maximum percentage of
their compensation allowed by the Code. The Company matches employee
contributions in an amount equal to fifty percent of the employee's
deferred compensation up to a maximum of $1,080 per year.
Participants are at all times fully vested in their contributions
and are gradually vested in the Company's contributions. The
Company's 401(k) contributions and administrative costs were $0
for 2003 and 2002.

(g)	Earnings Per Share
Basic earning per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net income
by the weighted number of common shares outstanding for the period.

(h)	Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts to
make them comparable to the 2003 presentation. These changes had no
impact on previously reported results of operations or shareholders'
equity.

2.	CASH BALANCES

The Company maintains cash accounts with various financial
institutions and stock brokerage firms. Cash balances are insured up
to $100,000 by either the Securities Investor Protection Corporation
("SIPC") or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). At
December 31, 2003, cash balances totaling $2,085,152 were uninsured
by either the SIPC or the FDIC.

3. INVESTMENT SECURITIES

In accordance with SFAS No. 115, the Company classifies all of its
current and noncurrent investments, as available for sale.
Following is a summary of the Company's investments:

	Current Assets:			 2003	       2002
	Cost				 $       --    $     --
	Gross Unrealized Holding Gain         3,290	      2,832

	Fair Value			 $    3,290	$     2,832
