Item 1. Description of
Business

(a) Business Development

Breccia International Minerals Inc.("Registrant")
was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware on April 25, 1975.  The  Registrant's
principal offices are located  at  #1500 Midland
Walwyn Tower, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada,  T5J  2Z2,
and it's  registered  office is 1209 Orange Street,
Wilmington,  New Castle, Delaware, 19801. The
telephone number is (403) 496-9171.

On  March  18,  1994, the Registrant received  a
Certificate  of Renewal from the State of Delaware.

The Registrant held an annual meeting on February 14, 1997 and approved
a reverse stock split and redesignation of share capital. The Registrant
consolidated the issued and outstanding $0.01 par value common stock on 
basis of one (1) $0.0001 par value stock for each twenty (20) $0.01 par
value common stock. The Registrant also redesignated the share capital to 
$0.0001 par value common stock and changed its name to Breccia International

(b) Business of Issuer

During the year, the Registrant seeked  out opportunities in the

tonnage  gold  and  copper deposits  located in Chile, South America.
An introduction to a prominant Chilean prospector was established
and several months of negotiating were involved in numerous
proposed agreements. However, due to uncontrollable market conditions
in the mineral exploration sector, the Registrant did not conclude an
agreement.

Consequently, the Registrant has shifted it's focus away from mining, and is
looking at other business opportunities.

The Registrant owns no patents, trademarks, licenses,
franchises, or concessions.

The  Registrant  has  no  portion of its business
which  may  be subject  to re-negotiation of profits
or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the
election of the Government.

development and no future research is proposed at
this time.

The  Registrant  has  not made any material capital
expenditures which require environmental control
facilities.

The Registrant currently has no full-time employees.

exploration or  interests in any properties directly
or through ownership  of partnership interests at

Auditors' Report





To the Shareholders of
Breccia International Minerals Inc.


We have audited the balance sheets of Breccia
International Minerals Inc. (formerly American
Energy & Technology Inc.) as at April 30, 1997
and 1996 and the statements of operations and
deficit and changes in financial position for the
years then ended. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards. Those
standards require that we plan and
perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance
whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.

In our opinion, these financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the company as at April 30,
1997 and 1996 and the results of its operations
and the changes in its financial position for the
years then ended in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

Nature of Business
Breccia International Minerals Inc. (the company) is a public company
incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A.
as American Energy & Technology Inc. on April 25, 1975 and renewed on
March 18, 1994.
                 
To April 30, 1997, the company has been involved in the process of
identifying and evaluating prospective business entities with a view
to the acquisition of a controlling or minority interest therein. Costs
related to these investigations are expensed as incurred.  The successful
acquisition of the investment will also be dependent upon the company's
ability to obtain necessary financing at that time.

Basis of Presentation

These financial statements have been prepared according to Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles.  However, as the U.S. dollar
is the principal currency in which the corporation's business is conducted,
