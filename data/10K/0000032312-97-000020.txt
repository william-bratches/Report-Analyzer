<PAGE>                              PART I
ITEM 1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

          The Registrant (sometimes alternatively referred to in this report
as the "Company" or "EMCEE") is a corporation, organized and existing under the
laws of the State of Delaware, having been incorporated in 1960.
          The Registrant is engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of
Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service ("MMDS") microwave transmitters and
related equipment for the wireless cable industry and low power television
("LPTV") transmitters and related equipment for the television broadcast
industry. These principal products are distributed primarily through the
Registrant's sales staff and independent representatives, with most sales
occurring in the commercial, educational and private television system markets.
The Registrant also provides all services relative to the design, procurementand
installation of television broadcast stations, with the exception of licensing
submissions.
          For more than the past three years, the Company's primary sales and
marketing focus has been on the wireless cable industry. While the Company was
also involved in the manufacture and sale of products to the LPTV market during
the same period of time, LPTV product sales have been overwhelmingly subordinate
to the Company's MMDS products. The Company anticipates that its MMDS sales will
continue to dominate in both domestic and foreign markets.
          At March 31, 1997, the Registrant employed 69 people, of whom 67 were
full time employees.
          The Registrant has a variety of raw material sources available to
conduct its present business. However, substantial periods of lead time for
delivery are sometimes experienced by the Registrant, making it necessary to
inventory varied quantities of materials.
          Significant portions of the Registrant's revenues come from contracts
with customers who generally do not place orders on a regular basis. In addition
the timing of these contracts relate to economic and regulatory developments
over which the Registrant has little or no control.
          In fiscal year 1997, purchases by three MMDS customers constituted,
in the aggregate, $4,448,809, or approximately 35.5% of the Company's net sales.
Although these purchases were significant in both amount and as a percentage of
sales, the Company's management believes that the loss of the contract the
Company has with only one of these customers would have a material adverse 
impact on the Company. That customer, which constituted approximately 16.9% of
the Company's net sales during fiscal year 1997, represents approximately 81% of
th eCompany's current backlog.
          The Registrant's principal suppliers are Andrew Corporation,
Scientific Atlanta, Inc., and Microwave Filter Company, Inc.
          Substantially all of the Registrant's domestic products must receive
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval prior to being marketed and
sold. The Registrant is currently in the process of securing FCC approval for
its DS line and the digital version of its HS line of MMDS transmitters.
          While FCC regulations, as promulgated or amended from time to time,
can have an effect on the demand for the Registrant's domestic products, the
Registrant does not presently know of any existing governmental regulation and
<PAGE>
does not anticipate any probable governmental regulation which would have a
material effect on its business. However, recently issued FCC regulations
concerning high definition television (HDTV) may, for an interim period during
which television stations must simulcast HDTV signals and ordinary television
signals, create a temporary market for a modified version of one of the
Registrant's LPTV transmitters which would facilitate such simulcasting. At this
time, though, it is not possible to predict whether such a temporary market for
this product will arise and what effect, if any, it will have on the 
Registrant's business.
          The amount of money spent on the Registrant's research and
development activities in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 was, respectively, $460,884
and $444,669. An additional $30,000 and $61,296 of research and development
costs were funded by customers in fiscal years 1996 and 1997, respectively.
          With respect to the Registrant's research and development activities,
it is relevant to note that the Registrant and a manufacturer of connection
equipment for internet and local loop telephony have been researching andtesting
the feasibility of using MMDS transmitters for high speed internet connections
and local loop telephony. However, given that this technology is still in the
development stages, the Registrant cannot predict with any degree of certainty
what, if any, effect it will have on the Registrant's business.
          Competitive conditions in the Registrant's industry continue to be
intense. Nevertheless, in the field of MMDS, the Registrant occupies a strong
position among its competitors.
          In the Registrant's opinion, the primary methods of competition in
its industry are product pricing, the ready availability of quality products to
accommodate demand, offering quality service of products after sale, and
maintaining a reputation for having a high degree of technical knowledge. 
          There has been no material effect on the Registrant as a result of
compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws. 
          The Registrant's principal corporate logos, "EMCEE" and "EMCEE
Broadcast Products", are registered in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office and are used by the Registrant pursuant to a license with its whollyowned
subsidiary corporation, EMCEE Cellular Inc., which owns the marks. In the same
manner, the Registrant also uses the trademark, "Site Lock", which is a mark
associated with a product sold by the Registrant that enhances picture quality
for MMDS systems in close proximity to systems operating on the same frequency,
and utilizes a patent for a solid state S-band transmitter.

ITEM 2.  DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY

          The Registrant conducts operations at its facility located on 25
acres, which the Registrant owns in fee, in White Haven, Pennsylvania.
          The building was constructed specifically for the Registrant in 1968
and consists of approximately 27,000 square feet, with the majority of the area
devoted to manufacturing. The front portion of the building, consisting of two
floors, houses administrative, engineering and sales offices. The land, building
and improvements are well maintained and in good condition.
          In the first quarter of fiscal year 1998, pursuant to a prior written
agreement, the Registrant conveyed an unimproved 1-acre parcel of the
Registrant's land, together with a 490' x 20' ingress/egress and utility
easement, to the White Haven Municipal Authority. No entry on the financial
<PAGE>
statements accompanying this report was made with respect to this conveyance, as
the value thereof was deemed not to be material.
          The Registrant's land, building and improvements are subject to
encumbrances held by the Registrant's primary lending institution, CoreStates
Bank, N.A. These encumbrances secure the Registrant's working line of credit,
mortgage loan and two term loans with the lender. As of the date of this report,
the aggregate principal balance of these encumbrances is $942,548.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

          There is no information relevant to the Registrant which must be
disclosed under this Item 3.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

          No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 1997.

                             PART II

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

HOLDERS
          At March 31, 1997, the number of holders of the Registrant's common
stock was 1,622.
<PAGE>
DIVIDENDS
          No dividends were declared during fiscal year 1996 or fiscal year
1997. The Registrant's loan documents with its primary lending institution
contain certain financial covenants with which the Registrant must comply in
order to declare and pay dividends on its common stock.

ITEM 6.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

          Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997 were $12,523,000,
a decrease of $1,770,000 or 12% from the net sales of $14,293,000 for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 1996.
          The primary reason for the reduction in sales was due to the halt in
shipments to the Company's primary customer in the second quarter of the fiscal
period.  Although shipments to this customer were at $2,113,000 (17% of total
sales and the highest sales to any one customer), sales to that customer hadbeen
anticipated to be approximately $5,000,000 for the 1997 fiscal year.
          The halt in these shipments, which are under a subcontract agreement
with a U.S. general contractor and are destined for Saudi Arabia, occurred due
to a frequency allocation issue not due to any responsibility of the 
Registrant.Although additional shipments did occur in the fourth quarter of 
fiscal year 1997, and while management believes a solution to the frequency 
allocation issue is imminent, the total contract will be materially reduced (See
the discussion below on the backlog of unsold orders).
          Also, domestic demand in the Multichannel Multipoint Distribution
Service (MMDS) industry started to decline in the second quarter of fiscal 1997
and continues to be low as operators wait for the successful testing and
installation of digital compression technology. Management is confident thatthis
technology will provide better picture quality and will increase programming
capacity four to five fold, but it believes that the market will not respond
until the next calendar year.
          Foreign sales, which included the previously mentioned subcontract
order, totaled $7,056,000 or 56% of shipments for the fiscal year ended March31,
1997, compared to $8,132,0000 for the previous fiscal year; domestic sales
equaled $5,467,000 for the fiscal 1997, compared to $6,161,000 for the like
period one year ago.
          Gross profit totaled $4,500,000 or 35.9% of net sales for the fiscal
year 1997, compared to $5,191,000  or 36.3% of net sales for fiscal 1996. EMCEE
produced product in which the Company receives higher margins than equipment
purchased from others for resale (referred to as O.E.M. sales) constituted 81%
of total sales for fiscal 1997, compared to 78% for fiscal 1996. However, this
slight increase in profit mix was offset by lower margins on the large
subcontract order referred to previously.
          Total operating expenses of $3,116,000 for the twelve month period
ended March 31, 1997 decreased by $156,000 or 4.8% from the immediatelypreceding
twelve month period. Selling expense decreased by $113,000 (7%) for the two
periods. Domestic related sales expenses decreased by 12% for fiscal 1997,
compared to fiscal 1996, while international related expenses increased by 8% 
for the same time frame reflecting the Company's efforts to increase its foreign
<PAGE>
market share.  Advertising expenses totaled $75,000 for the twelve months ended
March 31, 1997, compared to $150,000 for the twelve months ended March 31, 1996,
as the latter included a large outlay for set-up and publishing of a new
brochure.  Also, domestic advertising was curtailed in fiscal 1997 in 
recognition of the downturn in market demand.
          General and administrative expense totaled $1,186,000 for the year
ended March 31, 1997. This was a modest decrease from the total of $1,214,000for
the year ended March 31, 1996, although it was a higher percent of net sales at
9.5% for fiscal 1997, compared to 8.5% for fiscal 1996 due to the decrease in
sales volume.  Decreases were shown in public relations expense and salary and
salary related expenses while increased costs were experienced in depreciation
expense and additional reserve for bad debts.
          Research and development expenses totaled $445,000 for the year ended
March 31, 1997, which was $16,000 less than the previous fiscal year due to
additional credits for the non-recurring engineering received in the current
year.  The Registrant is committed to continue research and development and has
budgeted in excess of $500,000 for the fiscal year 1998 to maintain 
technological leadership in the MMDS industry.   
          Income from operations decreased to $1,384,000 (11% of net sales) for
the twelve months ended March 31, 1997 from $1,919,000 (13.4% of net sales) for
the twelve months ended March 31, 1996, due primarily to the decrease in sales
volume.
          On August 21, 1991, the Registrant entered into an agreement to sell
a cellular license for $3,100,000.  The amount of $1,000,000 was received in
fiscal 1992 with the balance of $2,100,000 plus interest at 7% to be paid on
December 16, 1996.  On March 27, 1997, following a lawsuit by the Company when
payment was not received, the parties agreed to a settlement of $2,500,000 to be
paid (and which was paid) on April 3, 1997 and an additional $500,000 to be paid
to the Company upon the occurrence of certain events, including a sale or
material change in ownership of the obligor. The Company recorded as income for
fiscal 1997 the proceeds on the sale of the license of $2,500,000 including 
interest income of $400,000.  The remaining $500,000 receivable is recorded on
the balance sheet and is fully reserved because there is no reasonable basis to
evaluate the likelihood of collection.
          Interest income for the fiscal year 1997 totaling $110,000 resulted
primarily from the investments of U.S. Treasury bills. The equivalent income for
the previous fiscal year totaled $105,000.
          Interest expense for fiscal 1997 totaled $93,000, compared to
$141,000 for fiscal 1996. The reduction of interest expense reflects the net
reduction of long-term debt during the twelve months ended March 31, 1997.Also,
in the prior fiscal year, a large commercial letter of credit was discounted at
an interest cost of $23,000.
          The Company sold one half of the 35,000 shares of an investment in
a wireless cable operator  during fiscal 1997 for a net gain of $210,000.
Additional other income of $32,000 was earned in the year ended March 31, 1997
primarily from forfeitures of customer deposits and rental income. The amount of
net other income for the previous year was $18,000.
          Net other income for the twelve months ended March 31, 1997 totaled
$2,759,000 which increased net income before provision for federal income taxes
to $4,143,000, compared to net income before federal income taxes of $1,901,000
for the prior fiscal year.

         Federal income taxes aggregated $1,127,000 and $306,000 for the
fiscal years ended March 31, 1997 and March 31, 1996, respectively. The
Registrant was able to reduce federal income taxes for both fiscal years by
utilizing a foreign sales corporation (FSC). There is no state tax liability for
these same periods since all profitable companies in the consolidated reporting
group are domiciled in jurisdictions that do not impose income taxes.
          Net income for fiscal year ended March 31, 1997 was $3,016,000, or
$.72 cents per common and common equivalent share, compared to net income of
$1,595,000 or $.36 cents per common and common equivalent share for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 1996.
          Selected financial data by quarter for the years ended March 31, 1997
and March 31, 1996 are as follows:

          As mentioned previously, the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 and first
quarter of fiscal 1997 were impacted favorably by the sales to one customer for
equipment destined for Saudi Arabia.  Earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal
1997 included $2,500,000 of proceeds on a Note Receivable connected with the 
sale of a cellular license.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
     
          Technical changes are inherent in the industry in which the
Registrant operates. It is impossible to accurately predict the future of the
wireless cable industry. The management of the Company believes in the
technological feasibility of digital compression in which the operator can
increase the number of channels from 33 to in excess of 150 and provide an
enhanced digital picture and video-on-demand programming. Management believes
further that High Definition Television Service (HDTV), local loop telephony and
Internet communication are areas where the expertise and research conducted by
the Company will provide internal growth for the next seven to ten years.
          In fiscal 1997 the Company's cash requirements were satisfied
principally from the cash flow from operations, cash on hand and customer
<PAGE>

deposits. These funds were sufficient to meet the Company's working capital
needs, capital expenditures and required debt payments.
          The Company recognizes that industry demand for the remainder of
calendar year 1997 will be less than the preceding calendar year, especially in
the domestic market. The Company believes that its financial strength as
evidenced by the balance sheet, especially the cash and cash equivalent amount,
will allow it to continue to develop and market the latest technology until the
demand increases.
          Cash and cash equivalents totaled $681,000 at March 31, 1997 compared
to $1,538,000 as of March 31, 1996; U.S. Treasury Bills increased from 
$1,569,000 to $1,679,000 for the same periods.  The net decrease in these 
accounts are due to the decrease in sales activity in the second half of fiscal 
1997 and the acquisition of treasury stock in the first quarter of fiscal 1997.
          Due to the decrease in sales volume, especially in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 1997 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996, the accounts
receivable balance, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, decreased from
$1,819,000 as of March 31, 1996 to $934,000 as of March 31, 1997. Customer
deposits on orders decreased in tandem from $526,000 as of March 31, 1996 to
$121,000 at March 31, 1997.
          Bad debt write-offs for fiscal 1997 totaled $30,000, the same as the
amount written off in the prior fiscal year. The reserve was increased from
$95,000 as of March 31, 1996 to $100,000 as of March 31, 1997 which management
believes is adequate.
          Inventories totaled $3,628,000 as of March 31, 1997, an increase of
$252,000 over the same date one year earlier. The increase was due primarily to
build-up for the previously mentioned customer which had been placed on "hold"
status. Restrictions have been placed on new inventory purchases in an endeavor
to relate inventory levels to sales levels.
          Accounts payable balance at March 31, 1997 of $355,000 is $430,000
less than the balance at March 31, 1996, reflecting the reduction of inventory
purchases.
          Deferred income taxes, which was an asset as of March 31, 1996,
became a liability as of March 31, 1997 due to the timing of the collection of
the cellular license settlement.
          The Note Receivable, which included interest of $400,000, increased
to $2,500,000 at March 31, 1997 from a net balance of zero as of March 31, 1996
due to the collection of the Note on April 3, 1997.An additional $500,000 of the
settlement agreement has been shown as a long-term receivable with a like amount
fully reserved as the likelihood or time of collection cannot be determined at
the time of this report.
          Capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997 totaled
$355,000 compared to $231,000 for the prior fiscal year. Of the total amount of
$355,000, approximately $272,000 was used to procure testing equipment including
$76,000 for digital testing. Capital assets of $388,000, which were fully
depreciated, were "scrapped" and written-off during fiscal 1997.Included in this
write-off was an amount of $221,000 for the old data processing hardware and
software which was replaced in fiscal 1996. Depreciation expense for fiscal 1997
totaled $243,000, an increase of $44,000 from the previous fiscal year.Plans for
future expansion of the Registrant's production and office space as mentioned in
last year's annual report have been delayed until sales volume increases. The
Company has, since June 1996, leased approximately 1,500 square feet of space
used for research and development.
<PAGE>
          The balance shown in the category "Other Assets" for March 31, 1996
in the financial statements accompanying this report included $212,000 for the
Company's investment in a Wireless Cable operator. In fiscal 1997 the Company
sold one half of this investment for $318,200. The remaining stock of the
operator, which was acquired by a Regional Bell Operating Company, was sold
during the first quarter of fiscal 1998 for $383,300. The remaining $2,000
difference between these accounts for the respective dates represents costs
associated with organizing subsidiaries of the Registrant.
          In February 1997, the Company refinanced its borrowing with  a
different financial institution as follows:
          1.  Line of credit of $2,000,000 bearing interest at the bank's prime
rate less 1/2 percent or LIBOR plus 175 basis points.  There are no borrowings
outstanding as of March 31, 1997.
          2.  Mortgage bearing interest at the bank's prime rate plus 1/4
percent or LIBOR plus 225 basis points.  As of March 31, 1997, the mortgage
aggregated $735,000 and required monthly principal payments of $4,083 plus
interest at LIBOR plus 225 basis points, which was 7.6875%.
          3.  Term loan bearing interest at the bank's prime rate or LIBOR plus
200 basis points. At March 31, 1997, $152,000 was outstanding bearing interest
at 7.4375% with monthly principal payments of $2,533. An additional amount of
$70,000 was borrowed on April 1, 1997 at the same interest rate and required
monthly principal payments of $1,218.
          Although the change produced favorable interest rates, Management's
decision to change was based on the international expertise provided by the new
financial institution.
          Long-term debt, less the current portion of $108,000, equaled
$807,000 as of March 31, 1997, compared to $938,000 as of March 31, 1996.
          Accrued expenses at March 31, 1997, which consisted  of payroll and
related expenses of $207,000 and other of $130,000 for a total of $337,000 was
$216,000 less than the balance of $553,000 for the same date one year ago.
Reductions in accrued payroll included an amount of $98,000 for officers and
management bonuses accrued as of March 31, 1996. Bonus calculations are based on
income from operations goals that were not achieved for fiscal 1997. Reductions
also incurred in payroll tax liability of approximately $45,000 as these are now
paid through electronic funds transfer (EFT). An amount of $37,000 included in
other accrued expense as of March 31, 1996 represented the final deferred 
portion of an asset purchased in fiscal 1996 with final payment in April 1997 
and reclassified as accounts payable at March 31, 1997.
          Common stock and additional paid-in capital accounts increased $45,000
during the year ended March 31, 1997 as employees exercised stock options for 
19,000 shares at an average price of $2.37 (See note 8 to the financial 
statements accompanying this report for further discussion).
          In May, 1996, the Registrant, through a subsidiary, purchased 200,000
shares of the Company's stock from the estate of a former director through an
agreement negotiated with the beneficiary for $1,262,500. In consideration of
this agreement, the Company has issued a nonnegotiable, non-transferable stock
warrant to the beneficiary that expires on May 22, 2001, for 200,000 shares of
the Company's stock at an exercise price of $9.46875 per share.
          In addition, 5,438 shares of the Company stock was purchased from
former employees (including 2,184 shares from a former officer) under the KSOP
Plan Agreement for an aggregate amount of $47,710.
          Inflation has not had a significant impact on cost or price in the
two fiscal years under review. However, as a significant portion of component
materials are obtained from sources outside the United States, the Registrant is
subject to the fluctuations in the international money market.
          The backlog of unsold orders amounted to $2,853,000 compared to
$10,912,000 as of March 31, 1996. The backlog as of March 31, 1997 has ben
restated to anticipate the expected change in the subcontract order for Saudi
Arabia.Indications are that a major portion if not all of this order will change
from analog to digital compression which would reduce the number of transmitters
required to complete the project. While this reduction valued at approximately
$4.3 million adversely affects the short-term sales, the Registrant believesthat
the participation in this new technology will enhance its reputation over the
next several years and initiate the potential for additional volume.  
          The Company employed 67 persons plus 2 part-time employees as of
March 31, 1997 compared to 83 (plus 9 part-time) people at March 31, 1996 and a
total high of 95 employees in July 1996. A further decrease to approximately 60
full and part-time employees occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 1998.

ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

          In February 1997, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard (SFAS) No. 128, Earnings per Share (SFAS No. 128) and SFAS No. 129
Disclosure of Information about Capital Structure. SFAS No. 128 replaces the
presentation of primary earnings per share with a presentation of basic earnings
per share. It also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per
share on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital
structures. SFAS No. 129 establishes standards for disclosing information about
an entity's capital structure. Management does not believe that SFAS No. 128 and
SFAS No. 129 will have a material effect on the financial statements of the
Company.

                    Independent Auditors' Report



Board of Directors
EMCEE Broadcast Products, Inc.
White Haven, Pennsylvania

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of EMCEE Broadcast Products,Inc.
and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1997 and 1996 and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the years then
ended.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EMCEE Broadcast
Products, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
               YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 1997 AND 1996

1.  Summary of significant accounting policies:

   Principles of consolidation:
   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 
    EMCEE Broadcast Products, Inc. and its subsidiaries, all of which are
    wholly-owned (together, the Company).  All significant intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

   Revenue recognition, sale of license:
   During 1992, a rural cellular license was sold for $3,100,000.  
    The initial payment was $845,000, net of closing costs of $155,000.  The
    balance, which bore interest at 7% payable at maturity, was due in
    December 1996.  The deferred payment and the related interest income was
    not previously recognized because of its extended collection period and
    because there was not a reasonable basis to evaluate the likelihood of
    collection.  On April 3, 1997 the Company collected $2,500,000 and
    received a non-interest bearing, unsecured $500,000 note receivable as
    settlement of the note.

   The $500,000 note receivable is due and payable upon the occur-
    rence of any one or more of certain specified events involving the debtor,
    including but not limited to acquisition, merger, bankruptcy, and
    insolvency.  None of the specified events relate to the debtor's normal
    operations.  The note receivable is fully reserved because it has no
    definite collection period and because there is not a reasonable basis to
    evaluate the likelihood of collection.

    Cash and U.S. Treasury Bills:
   The Company considers cash equivalents to be all highly liquid 
    investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. 
    U.S. Treasury Bills with an original maturity of more than three months
    are considered to be investments.  All U.S. Treasury Bills are stated at
    cost which approximates market and are considered as available for sale. 
    All U.S. Treasury Bills  not included as cash equivalents had contracted
    maturities of six months.

   Inventories:
   Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates
    current actual cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market (net      
    realizable value).

   Property, plant and equipment and depreciation:
   Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation 
    is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
    the assets.

1.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued):

   Advertising:
   These expenses are recorded when incurred.  They amounted to 
    $75,000 and $150,000 for 1997 and 1996, respectively.

   Fair value:
   The fair value of long-term debt that is variable rate debt that 
    reprices regularly, the notes receivable of $2,500,000 which were
    collected in April 1997 and U.S. Treasury Bills approximates the amounts
    recorded in the financial statements.  It was not practicable to estimate
    the fair value of the $500,000 note receivable at March 31, 1997 and the
    note receivable at March 31, 1996 because the Company was unable to
    estimate the timing and form of the ultimate settlement of the amounts due
    to it.  The Company has fully provided for any potential loss resulting
    from the non-payment of these receivables.

   Earnings per share:
   Earnings per common and common equivalent share are computed using 
    the weighted average number of shares outstanding adjusted for the
    incremental shares attributed to outstanding options to purchase common
    stock.

   Use of estimates:
   Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial 
    statements.  Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities and the reported revenues and expenses.

   Reclassification:
   Certain reclassifications have been made to 1996 balance sheet to 
    conform to the 1997 presentation.

2. Industry, sales and accounts receivable concentration information:

   The Company's primary activity is in one segment which consists 
    of the assembly and sale of equipment for the domestic and foreign
    television broadcasting industry.  Major customers are those that
    individually account for more than 10% of the Company's consolidated
    revenues.  For the years ended March 31, 1997 and 1996, two customers with
    total sales of $3,476,000 and two customers with total sales of
    $4,864,000, respectively,  qualified as  major customers.  Worldwide
    export sales amounted to $7,056,000 and $8,174,000 for 1997 and 1996,
    respectively.  At March 31, 1997, there were no significant accounts
    receivable concentrations.  The Company performs ongoing credit
    evaluations of its customers and typically requires deposits and a letter
    of credit on foreign sales and deposits on domestic sales.  Historically,
    the Company's uncollectible accounts receivable have been immaterial.

                                       -------------------------
5.  Line of credit:

   The Company has a line of credit agreement with a bank aggregating
$2,000,000 collateralized by inventories, accounts receivable and all property,
plant and equipment.  The line of credit agreement requires monthly interest
payments at .50% below the bank's prime rate of interest or 1.75% above LIBOR 
which was 5.4375% at March 31, 1997.  There were no principal borrowings during
the years ended March 31, 1997 and 1996.

   The loan agreement contains restrictive covenants when amounts are
outstanding which, among other things, require the Company to maintain a maximum
total liabilities to net worth ratio, a minimum current ratio and a debt 
coverage ratio. The Company is allowed to pay dividends on its common stock if
it is in compliance with the financial covenants and ratios.

6. Long-term debt (continued):

   The term loan, bank at March 31, 1997 matures in 2012 and requires 
    principal payments of $4,083, plus interest.  Interest is calculated at
    2.25% above LIBOR which was 5.4375% at March 31, 1997.  The bank has the
    option of adjusting the monthly payments required under this loan to
    provide for changes in the interest rates.  The term and equipment loans
    are cross-collateralized with and have the same restrictive covenants as
    the line of credit (see Note 5).

   Principal payments on long-term debt, based on current interest 
    rates, are as follows:

                       1998             $  108,000
                       1999                 79,000

                                        -----------
7. Defined contribution pension plan:

   A defined contribution pension plan covers all full time employees 
    who meet age and service requirements.  Contributions to the plan,
    determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors, were $29,000 in
    1997 and 1996.  

8. Common stock:

   Nonqualified stock option plans provide for the grant of options 
    to purchase up to 300,000 shares.  Upon the termination or expiration of
    any stock options granted, the shares covered by such terminated or
    expired stock options will be available for further grant; 37,100 options
    were available for grant at March 31, 1997.  The Board of Directors, at
    the date of grant of an option, determines the number of shares subject to
    the grant and the terms of such option.  All outstanding options granted
    expire after 5 years and vest over two years.

   At March 31, 1997, the range of exercise prices and the weighted-

    $6.16 and 3.4 years, respectively.

   The Company in accordance with an election under generally accepted       
    accounting principles for stock options has recorded no compensation cost 
    for its stock options in the accompanying consolidated financial state   
    ments.

   Had compensation cost been determined based on the fair value 
    at the grant dates for awards under the plans, the Company's net income
    and earnings per share would have been reduced to the proforma amounts
    disclosed below:

8. Common stock (continued):

   Proforma net income does not reflect options granted before April 1, 1995. 
      Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation cost for 
      stock options is not reflected in the proforma  amounts presented above  
      because compensation cost is reflected over the options' vesting period
      of two years and compensation cost for options granted in the year ended 
      March 31, 1995 are not considered.

   The fair values were determined using the Black-Scholes option-
    pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

    Earnings dividend yield              .0%
    Risk free interest rate            5.84%
    Expected life                     5 Years
    Volatility                        48.88%

   During 1997, warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of common stock at $9.76
a share were issued and remain outstanding at March 31, 1997.

 9. Income taxes:

   The following table sets forth the current and deferred amounts 
    of the provisions for income taxes for the years ended March 31, 1997 and
    1996:

shall have the discretion to cause a forfeiture of the grant of any Option if 
the Optionee has not executed and delivered the Stock Option Agreement by a date
certain specified by the Administering Body, which shall in no event be less
than seven (7) calendar days from the date the Stock Option Agreement is 
delivered to the Optionee for execution.
     5.2  The Expiration Date of each Option shall be fixed by the
Administering Body, but such expiration date shall not exceed ten (10) years 
from the Date of Grant. Provided that the Date of Grant of an Option shall 
precede the Termination Date, the expiration date thereof, subject to the 
immediately preceding sentence in this Section 5.2, may be subsequent to the 
Termination Date. 
     5.3  Notwithstanding any possible contrary interpretation of any provision

purchased are delivered to the Optionee.
     5.4  An Option may be exercised all at one time or in part from time to
time, at the discretion of the Optionee, during the term thereof; provided,
however, that each Stock Option Agreement shall provide that no Optionee may
exercise an Option, in whole or in part, until at least two (2) years have
expired from the Date of Grant; and provided further that no partial exercise of
an Option may be for less than one hundred (100) shares or, if less, the number
of shares remaining available thereunder.

expressly permitted herein, an Option shall terminate and become null and void
if it or the Stock Option Agreement therefor is transferred, assigned, pledged
or hypothecated in any way or becomes subject to any security interest, lien or
other encumbrance, or to levy, execution, attachment or similar process.
     5.6  Upon termination of an Optionee's employment with the Company or its
Subsidiary, or the date on which he ceases to be a director, as the case may be,
the Optionee's rights and privileges with respect to an Option granted to him
pursuant to this Plan shall be limited in the manner set forth in his Stock
Option Agreement or, if not specified therein, to the shares of Company Stock
subject to an Option or Options which were exercisable by him on the date ofsuch
termination or cessation, with such Option rights and privileges to expire and
the Stock Option Agreement(s) therefor to terminate in thirty (30) calendar days
from such date.
     5.7  If an Optionee shall die while all or any part of an Option granted
to him under this Plan remains outstanding, then, notwithstanding Section 5.5
hereof, such Optionee's personal representative shall have one hundred eight
(180) calendar days from the date of the Optionee's death to exercise such
Option, to the extent it is exercisable during such time, after which such 
Option shall expire and the Stock Option Agreement therefor shall terminate.
                 ARTICLE VI - FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES
     6.1  Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Plan or in any
Stock Option Agreement, in the event the Company resolves to (1) consolidate or
merge with or into another corporation, (2) accept an offer to purchase thirty
(30%) percent or more of the then issued and outstanding Company Stock, (3) sell
all or substantially all of its assets, or (4) voluntarily or involuntarily
dissolve or liquidate, then, in any such event, the Administering Body may
terminate all Options then outstanding in whole or in part and the Stock Option
Agreements therefor after having given thirty (30) days advance written notice
to each Optionee, during which time each such Optionee shall have the right to
exercise, to the extent then exercisable, his Option or Options in accordance
with this Plan and his Stock Option Agreement(s).
               ARTICLE VII - TERMINATION; AMENDMENT
     7.1  The Board may at any time, upon recommendation of the Committee, if
the Committee is then the Administering Body, but otherwise in its sole
discretion, terminate and in any respect amend this Plan; provided, however,that

the Optionee.
     7.2  Notwithstanding Section 7.1 hereof, in no event shall this Plan be
amended more than once every six months, other than to comport with changes in
the Code or ERISA, or the rules thereunder, with respect to any provision 
<PAGE>

hereof which may now or hereafter cover "formula awards" as described in Rule 
16b-3 under the 1934 Act.
                   ARTICLE VIII - MISCELLANEOUS

upon any Optionee the right to continue in the Company's or any Subsidiary's
employ, or to continue to be engaged as a director thereof, as the case may be.
     8.2  The adoption of this Plan shall not affect any other stock option,

              OFFICERS' INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN

1.   Purpose of Plan

     To provide additional incentive to the participants to increase their
     contribution to the achievement of company objectives by providing
     significant and competitive incentive compensation that relates directly
     to the performance of the company and the business results achieved,
     thereby promoting and protecting the interests of the shareholders and
     enhancing the Company's ability to attract, retain, and motivate and
     compensate key management employees. The plan is authorized by the Board
     of Directors and, once established, can be changed only by their approval. 

 2.  Eligibility for Participation

     Participation in the Plan for any year shall be the officers, excluding
     the President 

 3.  Establishment of Goal

     The goal will be the income from operations established in the budget
     prepared by the management, and approved by the Board of Directors for the
     ensuing fiscal year. The amount for the base will be the Income from
     Operations as promulgated by this budget including all incentives based on
     profitability. 

4.   Incentive Award Calculation

     The award calculation will be equal to the Income from Operations for the
     fiscal year as certified by the auditing firm and including any and all
     adjustments necessary to receive such certification compared to the budget
     established in section 3 above and will include all incentive awards
     including incentive awards for officers and key employees. To establish
     the basis for calculating the incentive award, Income from Operations will
     include incentive award amounts and officers bonus amounts equal to the
     budgeted dollar amounts for the fiscal period in which the award is
     calculated. 

5.   Individual Award Calculation

     The award will be based as a percent of the base salary received by the
     qualified individual for the period April 1 through March 31 in which the
     award is calculated. 

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN - Continued

     A)   The salary class level as shown on the Salary Administration
          Bulletin (PS1-2) as of December 31 of the fiscal year (Officers are
          Level 11 ) and; 

<PAGE>

     B)   Years of service at December 31 as follows: 
          6 months but less than 5 years     =    0
          5 years but less than 10 years     =    1
          10 years but less than 15 years    =    2
          15 years but less than 20 years    =    3
          20 years and up                    =    4

     Example:  Subject employee is a level 8 with 17 years service: 
               Level 8   =    8 
               17 Years  =    3 
               TOTAL          11%
                            -----
 6.  Proration of Incentive Award

     The minimum amount will be awarded if actual Income from Operations, as
     stated in section 4 is at least 75% of such stated goal. The award will be
     the ratio of the achieved amount to the predetermined goal with a maximum
     of 150% achieved and rounded to the nearest whole percent.  

 7.  Examples

     A)   Income from Operations is budgeted for $3,000,000. The actual Income
          from Operations totals $2,850,000 with incentives included as
          budgeted.
          1.   The incentive goal is $3,000,000.
          2.   The amount to be awarded an individual would be 95%
               ($2,850,000 + $3,000,000).

     B)   With the same budget, the company's actual Income from Operations 
          is   $3,250,000 with incentives included as budgeted.
          1.   The amount to be awarded is $3,250,000 + $3,000,000 or
               108%.

     C)   The individual shown in the example in section 5 would receive 10%
          (11% x .95) of his base salary in example A above: 12% (11% x 1.08)
          in example B above.
