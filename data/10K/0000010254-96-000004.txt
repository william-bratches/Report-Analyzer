Part I

                                       ITEM 1
                               DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. (Basic or the Company), was originally
organized in July 1969 and became a public company in 1980.  The Company is
principally engaged in the acquisition, exploitation, development, operation and
production of crude oil and natural gas.  The Company's primary areas of
operation are the Williston basin in North Dakota and Montana, south Texas and
the D-J basin in Colorado.

Business Development

Since 1994, the Company's new management has undertaken a strategy which
redirects the Company's existing capital into productive and economic oil and
gas properties, focuses on increasing reserves through the acquisition and
improvement of producing properties, and re-establishes banking relationships
which may provide debt financing for these purposes.  Despite the fact that many
companies are moving away from an acquisition strategy, management believes that
opportunities still exist to increase reserves through the acquisition and
improvement of producing properties.  In fact, given the Company's size, its
shortage of external funding and its existing internal staff strengths, this may
be one of the few strategies which the Company may be able to pursue
successfully.  The Company's acquisition strategy is based largely on the exodus
of major and large independent oil and gas companies from the United States to
overseas areas.  Management believes this exodus or divestiture of producing
properties is particularly intense in the Rocky Mountain region.

In pursuing this plan, in its fiscal year ending March 31, 1995, the Company
reported it successfully established a new banking relationship, the drilling
and recompletion of four wells on its Antenna Federal Prospect, the sale of its
office building and move of its offices from the suburbs to downtown Denver,
Colorado, the sale of deep exploration rights in south Texas and the acquisition
of approximately sixty properties in the Williston basin.  Management reported
that these activities resulted in a 41% increase in the discounted present value
of Basic's estimated proved reserves at year end from approximately $3.3 million
to $4.7 million.

As a result of these efforts, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996, oil and
gas sales revenue increased 97% from approximately $1.4 million to approximately
$2.8 million and Cash Flows from Operating Activities increased 484% from
$134,000 to $782,000.  Production expense was higher than expected and net
income was lower than expected due to the magnitude of unanticipated repair
costs associated with equipment on recently acquired Williston basin properties.
(See further discussion in Results of Operations, Expenses.)

In October 1995, the Company reported it participated with an unrelated third
party in the recompletion of the State #12-16, in Richland County, Montana.  The
well was reported to have an initial potential of 147 barrels of oil, 16 barrels
of water and 112 MCF of gas per day from the Bakken formation.  The well
previously produced an average of 9 barrels of oil, 11 barrels of water and 4
MCF of gas per day from the Madison formation.  Basic owns a fifty percent (50%)
working interest in the well.  

Following this success, the Company undertook one other recompletion attempt
which was unsuccessful.  Further recompletion attempts were curtailed when the
cash requirements created by these two efforts and the magnitude of
unanticipated repair costs on Williston basin properties resulted in the
Company's inability to satisfy the liquidity covenant in its Loan Agreement. 
The Company reported this covenant violation to its bank and, upon request,
received a waiver from the bank for this violation.  To rectify the situation,
the Company drew on its line of credit to pay current liabilities as they became
due.  As of December 31, 1995, the Company was able to attain a current ratio
acceptable to its bank. 

As a result of the inability to satisfy the liquidity covenant and with the
onset of winter in the Williston basin, management curtailed recompletion
activities and thereafter focused on equipment repairs, cash requirements and
bank covenant compliance.  

Contemplated Activities

General  

The Company has begun implementation of its strategy by virtue of the various
activities described above.  Further implementation of its plan of operation is
described herein.  However, the Company may alter or vary its plan of operation
based upon changes in circumstances, unforeseen opportunities, inability to
negotiate favorable acquisition or loan terms, lack of funding and other events
which the Company is not able to anticipate.

Repairs  

In the fiscal year just ended, the Company has been adversely affected by the
magnitude of unanticipated repair costs associated with equipment on recently
acquired Williston basin properties.  Management expects these repair costs to
continue, albeit in decreasing amounts.  Indeed, subsequent to year end, the
Company has been required to replace the surface facilities associated with four
wells in McCone County, Montana.  The Company cannot predict the magnitude of
future repair activities nor the impact on future costs.  However, management
has noted that where it has undertaken the repair and/or replacement of
compromised equipment, operating and/or repair costs have been dramatically
reduced.  As a result, it is management's belief that the effect of these
repairs should, in the aggregate, become apparent in the current fiscal year.   
However, there can be no assurances that other failures will occur in the future
that would require significant repairs. 

Development  

The Company holds a number of properties that it believes may have the potential
for increased cash flow and may have additional unproved reserves which could be
exploited.  This exploitation may be realized by conventional and unconventional
petroleum engineering techniques and field management practices.  Management
expects to pursue these potential opportunities on a number of these properties
in the upcoming fiscal year.  However, there can be no assurances that funds
will be available to pursue such opportunities or that such efforts will be
successful.

Drilling  

While drilling is no longer the major focus of the Company's strategy, Basic may
participate in high quality development or exploratory prospects which
management believes are capable of increasing reserves and cash flow with
reasonable risk.

In this regard, the Company has agreed to participate with unrelated third
parties for a minority interest (10%) in the development of a small 3-D seismic
prospect in south Texas.  The Company's initial commitment is expected to be
$42,000.  Management believes the project provides exposure to "high tech"
exploration techniques and, if successful, is capable of increasing reserves and
cash flow with reasonable risk. 

Divestitures

The Company continues to hold a number of marginal, non-operated properties in
several states.  Management intends to divest itself of a number of these
properties in the current fiscal year.

Segment Information and Major Customers

Industry Segment  

The Company is engaged in only one segment of the oil and gas industry: oil and
gas exploration, production, operations and development.  The Company has no
gathering, transportation, refining or marketing functions.

Markets  

The Company's oil and natural gas is sold to various purchasers in the
geographic area of its properties.  Oil and natural gas liquids are hauled by
truck from tanks at or near the wellhead, or collected by pipeline, for
transportation to refineries.  Natural gas is collected by a gathering system
and, after processing, is distributed through pipelines to end-users.   Basic is
a small company and, as such, has no impact on the market for its goods and
little control over the price received.  The market for, and the value of, oil
and natural gas are dependent upon a number of factors including other sources
of production, competitive fuels and proximity and capacity of pipelines or
other means of transportation, all of which are beyond the control of Basic.  

The Company believes that substantially all domestic oil which is produced can
be readily sold at prevailing market prices.  The oil prices the Company
receives are slightly lower than the benchmark U.S. crude spot price because of 
adjustments for location and grade.  The price of domestic oil fluctuates due to
supply and demand forces.  Since there is strong competition among purchasers,
management does not believe it is dependent on any one purchaser or group of
purchasers. 

In the year ended March 31, 1996, Basic sold 71 percent of its oil and gas
production to a total of three purchasers:  34 percent to Cenex, Inc., 19
percent to Murphy Oil USA, Inc. and 18 percent to Norco Crude Gathering, Inc. 
Sales to no other customer of Basic (or group of customers under common control)
were equal to 10 percent or more of oil and gas sales.

Substantially all of Basic's gas production is sold at prevailing wellhead gas
prices, subject to additional charges customary to an area.  Basic does not own
or operate any gas gathering or processing plant facilities nor does it possess
sufficient volume on any pipeline to market its product to end-users.

Competition

The oil and gas industry is a highly competitive and speculative business.  The
Company encounters strong competition from major and independent oil companies
in all phases of its operations, particularly in the acquisition of economically
desirable producing properties and drilling prospects. Competition is intense
with respect to the acquisition of large producing properties, or large packages
of producing properties. These multiple well packages are particularly
competitive if they include partially developed properties or properties with
natural gas attributes.  In this arena, the Company must compete with many
companies having financial resources and technical staffs significantly larger
than its own.  However, management believes that the competition for smaller
properties, especially distressed properties, is less intense.  Because of the
limited capital resources available to the Company, management has focused on
these smaller and/or distressed properties in its acquisition efforts.

Regulations

General  

The operations of the Company are affected in varying degrees by federal, state,
regional and local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, laws
governing allowable rates of production, well spacing, air emissions, water
discharges, reporting requirements, endangered species, marketing, prices, and
taxes.  The Company is further affected by changes in such laws and by
constantly changing administrative regulations. To the best of its knowledge,
the Company is in compliance with all such regulations and is not aware of any
claims which could have a material impact upon the Company's financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Federal Taxation  

During fiscal 1993, The Comprehensive National Energy Policy Act (Act) was
signed into law.  The Act provides for various incentives and revenue-raising
provisions.  Perhaps most significant to independent oil and gas companies are
the provisions repealing certain intangible drilling cost and statutory
depletion tax preferences for the purposes of calculating the alternative
minimum tax.  While provisions are favorable to the oil and gas industry, Basic
will not realize current benefits because of  its relatively high, non-cash
depletion expense and a substantial net operating loss carryforward.

Natural Gas Pricing  

During fiscal 1992, the Federal Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued FERC Order
636 and subsequent related orders (the Order) which are intended to ensure that
pipelines provide transportation service that is equal in quality for all gas
suppliers, whether the customer purchases gas from the pipeline or from a
different supplier.  While the Company views this Order as favorable to natural
gas producers, it is not suspected to have a material impact on Basic in that
the vast majority of the Company's production is crude oil rather than natural
gas.

Environmental Matters  

The Company is subject to various federal, state, regional and local laws and
regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of,
the environment.  These laws and regulations, among other things, may impose
liability on the owner or the lessee for the cost of pollution clean up
resulting from operations, subject the owner or lessee to liability for
pollution damages, require the suspension or cessation of operations in affected
areas and impose restrictions on injection into subsurface aquifers that may
contaminate ground water.  Although environmental requirements do have a
substantial impact upon the energy industry, these requirements do not appear to
affect Basic any differently than other companies in this industry who operate
in a given geographic area. The Company is not aware of any environmental claims
which could have a material impact upon the Company's financial condition,
results of operations, or cash flows. 

Such regulation has increased the resources required and costs associated with
planning, designing, drilling, operating and both installing and abandoning oil
and natural gas wells and facilities.  Indeed, within the fiscal year just
ended, the Company has had to dedicate additional staff resources to the task of
complying with developing, changing and expanding environmental regulations.  As
yet, Basic has not had to hire any new employees to comply with these
regulations. The Company will continue to make expenditures in its efforts to
comply with these requirements, which are unavoidable business costs in the oil
and gas industry.

Although the Company is not fully insured against all environmental and other
risks, it maintains insurance coverage which it believes is customary in the
industry.

Other

In the year just ended, the Company was not involved in any research and
development efforts, nor does management anticipate any such efforts in the
coming fiscal year.  There are no significant patents, trademarks, licenses,
franchises or concessions held by the Company.

The oil and gas business is not generally seasonal in nature, although unusual
weather extremes for extended periods may increase or decrease demand for oil
and natural gas products temporarily.  Additionally, catastrophic events, such
as hurricanes or other supply disruptions, may also temporarily increase the
demand for oil and gas supplies.  Such events and their impacts may cause
fluctuations in quarterly or even annual revenues and earnings.

Basic's offices are located at 633 Seventeenth Street, Suite 1670, Denver,
Colorado  80202 (telephone number 303-294-9525).  At the end of its fiscal year,
the Company had ten employees: five at its main office in Denver, Colorado and
five at its subsidiary's field office in Bruni, Texas, located forty-five miles
east, southeast of Laredo, Texas.

                               DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY

Producing Properties: Locations and Impact 

As of March 31, 1996, Basic owned an interest in 115 oil wells and 20 gas wells.
Basic currently operates 82 wells in five states: North Dakota, Montana, 
Colorado, Texas and Wyoming.  These operated wells contributed approximately
75.7 percent of Basic's total liquid hydrocarbon sales and approximately 66.3
percent of total gas sales in the year ended March 31, 1996.  The majority of
Basic's operated liquid reserves are located in the Williston basin of North
Dakota and Montana and in south Texas while the majority of Basic's operated gas
reserves are located in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg basin.  Substantially all
producing properties are encumbered and used to secure bank debt.

Reserves 

At March 31, 1996, the discounted present value of Basic's estimated proved
reserves was approximately $4,725,000 reflecting a 41.2% increase over the
previous year's reserves of $3,347,000.  This increase was primarily the result
of an increase in the price of oil over the price at March 31, 1995 and the
reserves added following the successful recompletion of the State #12-16 into
the Bakken formation, in addition to the purchase of numerous small interests in
various wells which Basic operates.  The analysis of Basic's oil and gas
reserves and the financial analysis of the oil and gas properties are in Notes 1
and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Leasehold Acreage 

The Company leases the rights to explore for and produce oil and gas from
mineral owners.  Leases (quantified in acres) expire after their primary term
unless oil or gas production is established.  Prior to establishing production,
leases are considered undeveloped.  After production is established, leases are
considered developed or "held-by-production."  Basic's acreage is comprised of
developed and undeveloped acreage.  Typically, undeveloped acreage is considered
an indication of the Company's "raw material" and, therefore, its potential to
replace reserves in the future.  Basic's strategy is the acquisition of
producing properties.  Given this strategy, there is no need for Basic to amass
undeveloped acreage blocks.  As a result, Basic has a minimal amount of
undeveloped acreage relative to exploration companies.  Management believes this
is a reflection of the Company's strategy rather than its ability to replace
reserves.

Office Building  

During the fiscal year ended March 1995, Basic sold its 6,700 square foot office
building which was its corporate headquarters.  Following this transaction,
Basic subleased office space and moved its corporate headquarters to downtown
Denver.  The building was encumbered by a mortgage.  (See Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Field Service Equipment  

At March 31, 1996, the Company's subsidiary, Basic Petroleum Services, Inc.,
owned a 60' trailer house/field office, a shallow pulling rig, a large winch
truck, a skid-mounted cementing unit, four pickup trucks and six ancillary
service vehicles.  None of the vehicles are encumbered.

                                OR PLAN OF OPERATION

Capital Structure and Liquidity

Financing  

The Company recognizes the importance of developing its capital resource base in
order to pursue its objectives.  However, subsequent to its last public offering
in 1980, debt financing has been the sole source of external funding.  

Bank Debt

On September 13, 1995, the Bank and the Company modified its previous loan
agreement to create a "Declining Balance, Revolving Line of Credit" (DBRLOC) and
increased the face amount of the promissory note to $2,500,000.  The Company is
now able to draw on the DBRLOC up to $2,500,000 or the borrowing base, whichever
is less.  At March 31, 1996 the Company's borrowing base was at $1,020,000, but
declines monthly by the minimum required principal payment.  Under the DBRLOC
and note, the Company is required to make monthly principal payments until May
31, 1998.  Information concerning the Company's debt appears in Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Hedging  

Hedging techniques are traditionally used to limit exposure to price
fluctuations.  Given the financial leverage created by its bank debt and the
magnitude of the near-term principal payments, fluctuations in crude oil prices
may have an impact on the Company's financial affairs.  Accordingly, during the
past year the Company entered into futures and/or options contracts in order to
hedge its exposure to any material fluctuations in crude oil prices.  The
Company has not hedged any gas production.  Information concerning the Company's
hedging activities appears in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity  

The Company's current ratio increased from .7:1 at March 31, 1995 (1995) to
0.9:1 at March 31, 1996 (1996).  A specific Bank covenant requires the
maintenance of a current ratio of 1:1, after adjustment by the removal of the
current portion of long-term debt.  At March 31, 1996, the Company was in
compliance with all Bank covenants and the Company's current ratio was 1:1 as
calculated per the provisions of the covenants. 

During the fiscal year just ended, current assets decreased 4% from $720,000 at
1995 to $717,000 at 1996 while current liabilities decreased 16% from $986,000
at 1995 to $825,000 at 1996.  Cash increased $9,000 (11%) from $83,000 at 1995
to $92,000 at 1996.  

Liquidity Outlook  

The Company's primary source of funding is the net cash flow from the sale of
its oil and gas production.  The profitability and cash flow generated by the
Company's operations in any particular accounting period will be directly
related to: (a) the volume of oil and gas produced and then sold,  (b) the
average realized prices for oil and gas sold, and (c) lifting costs.  Assuming
that oil prices do not decline significantly from current levels, management
believes the cash generated from operations will enable the Company to meet its
existing obligations as they become due in fiscal year 1997.  If the Company is
able to hedge future production, especially through March 1997, then even if oil
prices decline significantly from current levels, management believes the cash
generated from operations and hedging activities will enable the Company to meet
its existing obligations as they become due in fiscal year 1997.

Impact of Inflation  

Inflation has not had a great impact on the Company in recent years because of
the relatively low rates of inflation in the United States.

Capital Resources; Requirements and Alternatives

Overview  

In addition to its routine and predictable production-related costs, its general
and administrative expenses and its debt repayment requirements, the Company
requires capital to fund the development and enhancement of recently acquired
properties and the capital to fund the acquisition of additional properties. 
The Company intends to fund its immediate needs for these efforts with the use
of its internally-generated cash flow from operations, industry and/or
investment partners, and new financing, all of which may or may not be generated
or obtained.

Other Commitments    

As of June 17, 1996, the Company has no obligations to purchase or sell any of
its oil and gas properties nor any other commitments beyond its hedging
activities and the 3-D seismic shoot in which it has agreed to participate (See
Item 1, Contemplated Activities, Drilling).

New Debt/Equity Financing  

The Company's balance sheet and borrowing base have little capacity for
additional debt.  Unless the Company is successful in exploiting undeveloped
potential from recently acquired properties, and thus add to the Company's
borrowing base, management does not believe it can successfully secure
additional bank debt without securing additional equity capital.

Given Basic's size and the current price of the Company's stock, management
believes additional equity would be difficult and expensive to obtain.  At the
same time, management is acutely aware of the need for additional equity
financing in order to fund future growth.  While addressing the care and
concerns of existing shareholders, management is in the initial stages of
exploring methods of developing a stronger capital base.  However, it must be
stressed, there are no assurances that equity financing is available or can be
attained by the Company.  Furthermore, pursuit of equity financing may alter or
vary due to changes in circumstances, unforeseen costs or difficulties,
unforeseen opportunities and other events which the Company is not able to
anticipate.

Results of Operations

1996 Compared with 1995

Overview  

Operations in fiscal year ended March 31, 1996 (1996) resulted in $6,000 of net
income compared to net income of $90,000 for fiscal year ended March 31, 1995
(1995).

Revenues  

Oil and gas sales revenue increased $1,384,000 (97%) from 1995.  Of this amount,
$1,319,000 (95%) was attributable to increases in oil production and $23,000
(2%) was attributable to strengthening oil prices.  Furthermore, $68,000 (5%)
was attributable to gas volume increases while -$26,000 (-2%) was attributable
to weakening gas prices.

Volumes and Prices  

Total liquid production increased 117%, from 69,000 barrels in 1995 to 150,000
barrels in 1996, while the average price per barrel increased slightly from
$16.26 in 1995 to $16.43 in 1996.  Total gas production increased 22%, from
175,000 MCF in 1995 to 214,000 MCF in 1996, while the price per MCF dropped 7%,
from $1.75 in 1995 to $1.63 in 1996.  The increase in liquid production was due
to the Williston basin acquisition completed near the end of fiscal 1995.  The
increase in gas production was primarily due to development drilling and
recompletion on the Company's Antenna Federal prospect in Weld County, Colorado.
Both liquid and gas production increases were partially offset by normal
production declines.

Expenses  

Oil and gas production expense and production taxes increased $1,164,000 (137%)
in 1996 from 1995 primarily as a result of the Williston basin acquisition
completed near the end of fiscal 1995.  The overall lifting cost per equivalent
barrel increased 25% from $8.67 in 1995 to $10.85 in 1996.   This
disproportionate increase in lifting cost is due to a higher percentage of oil
versus gas production following the Williston basin acquisition and high initial
decline rates associated with newly drilled and/or recompleted gas wells. 
Compounding this problem are the previously disclosed, unanticipated repair
costs associated with equipmnt on recently acquired Williston basin properties. 
These repair costs have two components.  First, the costs due to the elevated
level of recurring, but seemingly routine, equipment failures and associated
attempts to repair (keep in service) compromised equipment (a cost which is
expensed).  Second, once identified and determined to be economically justified,
the costs to replace and/or refurbish surface and subsurface equipment (a cost
which is capitalized).  The Company expects these repair costs to continue,
albeit in decreasing amounts, as the Company discovers, repairs and replaces
compromised equipment and/or abandons or sells wells where replacement of such
equipment cannot be economically justified.  While the impact of these costs is
evident on current oil and gas production expense, the Company cannot predict
the magnitude of future repair activities nor the impact on future costs.

Depreciation and depletion expense increased $193,000 (55%) in 1996 from 1995.
This increase was primarily due to increases in produced volumes resulting from
the Williston basin acquisition mentioned above.  The effect of the increase in
produced volumes was partially offset by a decrease in the depletion expense per
equivalent barrel.  In this regard, the depletion expense per equivalent barrel
decreased 16% from $3.41 in 1995 to $2.87 in 1996, primarily because of the
increase in reserve volumes.  However, the depletion rate, as a percent of the
full cost pool, increased from 11% in 1995 to 17% in 1996.

Net general and administrative expense decreased $88,000 (37%) in 1996 from
1995.  This decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of
Company-operated properties, and associated administrative overhead fees
following the Williston basin acquisition mentioned above.  Administrative
overhead fees are charged to various properties which the Company operates and
serve to reduce gross general and administrative expenses.  Such charges are
made in recognition of the cost of office activities incurred in the
administration of Company operated properties. Also contributing to the overall
decrease in general and administrative expense were decreases in building
expenses, bad debt expense and outside professional fees which were partially
offset by increases in salaries and office expenses.  As a result of the overall
decrease, and in conjunction with increased production volumes, general and
administrative expense per equivalent barrel decreased from $2.43 in 1995 to
$.81 in 1996.

Other Income/Expense  

Other Income/Expense decreased $198,000 (192%), from a positive $103,000 in 1995
to a negative $95,000 in 1996.  This decrease was the result of certain
transactions which occurred in 1995 which were not repeated in 1996.  They
include sales proceeds being netted against receivables, writing-off dated and
disputed payables and partially offsetting receivables, and proceeds from the
sale of the Company's office building.  Additionally, interest expense on the
Company's bank debt increased significantly in 1996 from 1995.  See Note 2 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of bank debt.

costs per equivalent barrel of production are shown in the following table for

                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation   

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Basic Earth
Science Systems, Inc. (Basic or the Company) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

Oil and Gas Producing Activity   

Basic follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas activity. 
Accordingly, all costs associated with the acquisition, exploration and
development of oil and gas property are capitalized.  Should net oil and gas
property cost exceed an amount equal to the present value (using a 10% discount
factor) of estimated future net revenue from proved reserves, considering
related income tax  effects, as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission's ceiling limitation, the excess is charged to expense during the
period in which the excess occurs.  Basic did not incur a ceiling limitation
charge during the years ended March 31, 1996, 1995 or 1994. 

If a significant portion of Basic's oil and gas reserves are sold, a gain or
loss would be recognized; otherwise, proceeds from sales are credited to oil and
gas property cost.  In the years ended March 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, Basic 
credited oil and gas property cost for $29,000, $186,000 and $1,000,
respectively, as a result of the sale of its interest in certain oil and gas
property.

All of Basic's property is located in the United States.

All capitalized cost is depleted on a composite units-of-production method based
on estimated proved reserves attributable to the oil and gas property owned by
Basic.  Depletion per equivalent barrel of production was $2.87, $3.41 and $3.08
for the years ended March 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  There
are many factors, including global events, that may influence the production,
processing, marketing, and valuation of crude oil and natural gas.  A reduction
in the valuation of oil and gas properties resulting from declining prices or
production could adversely impact depletion rates and ceiling test limitations.

Support Equipment and Other   

When property and equipment other than oil and gas property is retired,
abandoned or sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed
from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operations.  Depreciation
of support equipment and other property is computed using various methods over
periods ranging from three to thirty years.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share   

Earnings (loss) per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of
shares outstanding for each period. The effect of the assumed exercise of any
outstanding stock options was anti-dilutive and, therefore, was excluded from
the computations.  The weighted average number of shares for the years ended
March 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 was 16,478,869, 16,593,614 and 16,739,777,
respectively.

Reclassifications  

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year
presentation.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Cash Flows,
Basic considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of ninety days or
less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  The carrying amount of cash
equivalents approximates fair value because of the short maturity of those
instruments.

Hedging  

Hedging techniques are traditionally used to limit exposure to price
fluctuations.  Given the financial leverage created by its bank debt and the
magnitude of the near-term principal payments, fluctuations in crude oil prices
may have an impact on the Company's financial affairs.  Accordingly, during the
past year the Company entered into futures and/or options contracts in order to
hedge its exposure to any material fluctuations in crude oil prices.  The
Company has not hedged any gas production.  Gains or losses attributable to such
contracts that hedge specific future deliveries are deferred and recognized in
income when the corresponding physical sale is recorded.

Under futures contracts, the Company receives or makes payments to the New York
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) via a trading account based on the differential
between the price at which any given contract was sold and the price at which it
was bought back (the closing price).  Under put option contracts, the Company
would receive payments from NYMEX if the closing price is greater than the floor
price at which the put option was purchased.  When a put option contract is
combined with the sale of a call option contract, a "collar" or a floor price
and a ceiling price is created.  In this situation the Company would receive
payments from NYMEX if the closing price is greater than the floor price at
which the put option was purchased or would make payments to NYMEX if the
closing price is greater than the ceiling price at which the call option was
sold.  If the closing price was between the floor and the ceiling both options
would expire unexercised and the Company would benefit by the amount the closing
price exceeded the floor price, less the cost of the option.  When a futures
contract is combined with the purchase of a call option contract, a "synthetic
put" is created.  In this situation, the futures contract would cause the
Company to receive or make payments to NYMEX as described above.  However, any
payment would be offset by, and to the extent, the closing price is greater than
the price at which the call option was purchased.  

At March 31, 1996, the Company had forty-two open futures and/or options
contracts to hedge future deliveries with maturities ranging from May 1996
through January 1997 at prices ranging from $18.08 to $21.47 per barrel.

Cash flows from hedging activities are classified as operating activities in the
Statement of Cash Flows.  The Company realized a $38,350 loss on its hedging
activities in 1996.  These losses were offset by receiving higher prices for
physical crude oil sales in 1996.  No hedging activities were undertaken in
1995.  The fair market value of the open futures and options contracts at March
31, 1996, using commodity prices in effect at March 31, 1996, would, if such
prices were to remain constant in the future, create an approximate loss of
$45,930.  If such a loss, or a portion thereof, were to occur, such loss
theoretically would be offset by receiving higher prices for physical crude oil
sales. 

For each futures contract and each call option contract that is sold, the
Company is required to furnish an initial cash margin.  In addition, to the
extent that the price of oil moves above the price each futures or call option
contract was sold, the Company is required to furnish an additional cash margin,
an event known as a margin call.  The purchase of put or call options does not
require a cash margin to be maintained.  If a margin call is not funded, NYMEX
will close the contracts and any unrealized loss would become a realized loss. 
The Company has executed a tri-party agreement to fund the initial margin
requirement and any margin calls up to $900,000 (See further information under
Debt).  Because of the volatility of oil prices, it is possible for this credit
limit to be exceeded.  One example of how this credit limit could be exceeded
would occur if the Company were to execute one hundred (100) contracts and the
price of oil were to increase nine dollars per barrel ($9/ Bbl) in each future
month in which the Company had a contract (other variations of this example
could result in credit limit exposure).  By loan covenant and Board of Director
direction, the Company is precluded from exceeding 75% of the average monthly
production demonstrated over the three preceding months.  At March 31, 1996,
approximately $150,000 of the $900,000 credit limit was being utilized.  During
the past year, the maximum credit utilization never exceeded $150,000.

The Company is not exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by a
counterparty in that such risk is borne by NYMEX.  Since each trader in each
future contract and put or call option sold is required to furnish an initial
cash margin and is subject to margin calls, nonperformance by NYMEX is
considered unlikely.

Continuation of hedging activities, at this level of coverage or at higher or
lower levels of coverage, may vary or change, due to change of circumstances,
unforeseen opportunities, inability to fund margin requirements, lending
institution requirements and other events which the Company is not able to
anticipate.

2.   Debt

Outstanding debt of Basic as of March 31, 1996 and 1995 is as follows:

                                   ========       ==========
</TABLE>

Bank Debt  

On August 1, 1994, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Norwest Bank
Colorado N.A. (the Bank) whereby the Company borrowed $500,000 and executed a
$500,000 promissory note payable to the Bank.

On March 30, 1995, the Bank and the Company modified this loan agreement to
provide the Company with an additional $690,000 and increased the face amount of
the promissory note to $1,120,000.  The loan was modified to accommodate the
acquisition of approximately sixty properties in the Williston basin of North
Dakota and Montana.

On September 13, 1995, the Bank and the Company modified its previous loan
agreement to create a "Declining Balance, Revolving Line of Credit" (DBRLOC) and
increased the face amount of the promissory note to $2,500,000.  The Company is
now able to draw on the DBRLOC up to $2,500,000 or the borrowing base, whichever
is less.  At March 31, 1996 the Company's borrowing base was at $1,020,000, but
declines monthly by the minimum required principal payment.  Under the DBRLOC
and note, the Company is required to make monthly principal payments until May
31, 1998 in the following minimum amounts:

     April 30, 1996 through December 31, 1996     $30,000 per month
     January 31, 1997 through December 31, 1997   $25,000 per month
     January 31, 1998 through April 30, 1998      $20,000 per month
     May 31, 1998                                 Balance of remaining
                                                  principal

The Company's borrowing base will be reviewed biannually and may be adjusted up
or down due to reevaluation of previously collateralized properties, addition of
newly acquired properties, increased reserves created by enhancements or
exploitation and rising or declining oil or gas prices.  At May 31, 1998, unless
the DBRLOC is again modified or the borrowing base is adjusted, the outstanding
principal balance potentially could be as high as $151,000.

In addition to the above described principal payments, monthly interest payments
are due on the unpaid principal balance at the Bank's fluctuating prime lending
rate plus two percent (2%).  In addition, quarterly, the Company is required to
pay a 1/2% commitment fee on the unused portion of the adjusted and declined
borrowing base.  As of March 31, 1996, the Company's effective annual interest
rate was 10.25%.

As a result of the foregoing loan modification, the Company now has the ability
to draw additional funds from the DBRLOC up to the then effective borrowing
base.  In addition, the Company may reduce the loan balance ahead of schedule
and be able to re-borrow up to the declined and/or adjusted borrowing base. 
Because of this flexibility, the current portion of long term debt has been
reduced by the difference between the borrowing base ($1,020,000) and the
outstanding debt ($801,000) or $219,000.   Had this adjustment not been made,
the current portion of long term debt would be $345,000. 

In addition to the above described DBRLOC, on September 13, 1995, the Bank and
the Company executed the collateral documents necessary to create a second
Revolving Line of Credit (RLOC) and make an additional $900,000 available for
the Company's hedging activities.  The terms of the RLOC were finalized in
December 1995 and funds under this second facility were made available.  In
addition to other requirements and restrictions, the funds from the RLOC can
only be used to fund margin requirements associated with the Company's hedging
activities.  At March 31, 1996 the Company had drawn approximately $150,000 from
this facility to fund the margin requirements associated with the hedging
activities described above under Note 1. 

Under the modified loan agreement, the Company must maintain certain covenants
with regard to various financial ratios, net worth, liens and other criteria. 
Failure to maintain any covenant, after a curative period, creates a default
under the loan agreement and requires the repayment of the then-existing
principal balance.  In addition to the foregoing, a specific event of default
occurs with the death, resignation or replacement of greater than fifty percent
(50%) of the current board of directors.  At March 31, 1996, the Company was in
compliance with all Bank covenants, including those regarding financial ratios,
net worth, liens, encumbrances and other criteria.

The DBRLOC and RLOC are collateralized and secured by mortgages on substantially
all of the Company's producing oil and gas properties and the Company's
hedging/margin account associated with the Company's hedging activities.

Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 and 119 require a
disclosure comparing the fair value of long-term debt relative to the carrying
value.  The Company's lines of credit require interest payments to be adjusted
by fluctuations in the Bank's prime lending rate.  Based on this, management
believes the fair value of long-term debt approximates the carrying value.

Mortgage Debt   

On September 1, 1994, the Company closed on the sale of its office building to
an unrelated third party for $382,000.  The transaction generated approximately
$38,000 in net sales proceeds after extinguishing the mortgage debt and paying
all penalties, commissions and fees. 

3.   Shareholders' Equity

Employee Stock Ownership Plan   

Basic's Employee Stock Ownership Plan covers substantially all employees who
have worked for Basic for at least six months and are employed at the end of the
Company's fiscal year.  The annual contribution is determined by the board of
directors based upon eligible employees' base salaries.  For the years ended
March 31, 1994 and 1995, the annual contribution was made using treasury stock. 
There was no contribution made for the year ended March 31, 1996.  

As previously disclosed, subsequent to the year ended March 31, 1995, the
Company filed an application with the Internal Revenue Service to terminate the
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the Plan) effective April 1, 1995.  This
application was made because of the high administrative costs associated with
maintenance of the Plan, the low percentage of proceeds which are received by
employees relative to total Plan costs, and the belief that alternative methods
of compensation will more effectively benefit the Company's employees.  The
application was approved by the Internal Revenue Service and the process for
final termination is under way.  The Company is reviewing several alternatives
in deciding how to replace the Plan.

4.   Major Customers 

Significant purchasers of 10% or more of Basic's oil and gas production are as
follows:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                                   1996      1995      1994

     Norco Crude Gathering, Inc.   18%       30%       ---
     Murphy Oil USA, Inc.          19%       28%       22%
     Associated Natural Gas, Inc.  ---       13%       ---
     Conoco, Inc.                  ---       10%       12%
     Mobil Oil Corporation         ---       ---       34%
</TABLE>

It is not expected that the loss of any of these customers would cause a
material adverse impact on operations since alternative markets for the
Company's products are available.


5.   Income Tax   

Basic and its subsidiaries file a consolidated income tax return.

As of March 31, 1996, Basic had available, to reduce future taxable income, tax
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $15,083,000 which approximates
alternative minimum tax net operating loss carryforwards, and which expire in
1997 through 2011.  The net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes is
different from the net operating loss carryforward for financial reporting
purposes primarily because of the expensing of intangible drilling and
development costs for tax purposes and the ceiling limitation charges for
financial reporting purposes.  For income tax purposes, investment tax credit
and excess statutory depletion carryforwards as of March 31, 1996 are
approximately $146,000 and $3,534,000, respectively. Investment tax credits are
accounted for using the flow-through method and expire in the year ended March
31, 2001.

In the first quarter of fiscal 1994, Basic implemented Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"), "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
effective as of April 1, 1993.  SFAS 109 requires recognition of deferred income
tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax laws for all temporary
differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets, liabilities and
carryforwards under SFAS 109.  Deferred tax assets are then reduced, if deemed
necessary (i.e., more likely than not), by a valuation allowance for the amount
of any tax benefits which, based on current circumstances, are not expected to
be realized.  The Company's adoption of SFAS 109 had no cumulative effect on
operations for the year ended March 31, 1996 since the net deferred tax asset of
$5,994,000 was offset by a valuation allowance of an equal amount.

The Company's deferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following
components at March 31, 1996 and 1995:
<TABLE>

                                             1996           1995

                                             ===========    ===========
</TABLE>
Basic has established a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty that the full
amount of the operating loss carryforwards will be utilized due to expiration
and other factors.  Although management expects improvement in the future
results of operations, it emphasizes past performance rather than income
projections when determining the valuation allowance.  Any subsequent
adjustments to the valuation allowance, if deemed appropriate due to changed
circumstances, will be recognized as a separate component of the provision for
income taxes.

6.   Related Party Transactions

It is the policy of Basic that officers or directors may assign to or receive
assignments from Basic in oil and gas prospects only on the same terms and
conditions as accepted by independent third parties.  It is also the policy of
Basic that officers or directors and Basic may participate together in oil and
gas prospects generated by independent third parties only on the same terms and
conditions as accepted by each other.

In the years ended March 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, there were no significant
related party transactions.

7.   Unaudited Oil and Gas Reserve Information 

Approximately ninety-six percent (96%) of the reserve estimates presented
herein, for the year ended March 31, 1996, were derived from reports prepared by
the independent petroleum engineering firm, Heinle & Associates, Inc (Heinle). 
The remaining four percent (4%) were prepared by Basic and were not audited by
Heinle. For the year ended March 31, 1995, approximately ninety-four percent
(94%) of the reserve estimates presented herein were derived from reports
prepared by Heinle.  The remaining six percent (6%) were prepared by Basic and
were not audited by Heinle.  For the year ended March 31, 1994, approximately
ninety percent (90%) of the reserve estimates presented herein were derived from
reports prepared by Heinle.  The remaining ten percent (10%) were prepared by
Basic and were not audited by Heinle.  The Company cautions that there are many
inherent uncertainties in estimating proved reserve quantities and in projecting
future production rates and the timing of development expenditures. 
Accordingly, these estimates are likely to change as future information becomes
available. 

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil,
condensate, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering
data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years
from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.

Proved developed reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered through
existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.

Analysis of Changes in Proved Reserves   

Estimated quantities of proved reserves (all of which are located within the
United States), as well as the changes in proved reserves during the periods
indicated, are presented in the following two tables:

In the year ended March 31, 1996, Basic received approximately $29,000 from an
unrelated third party for undeveloped acreage in Stark County, North Dakota. 
This $29,000 payment is reflected as a credit to unproved property acquisition
cost in the table above.

In the year ended March 31, 1995, Basic received approximately $186,000 from an
unrelated third party for an assignment of deep rights underlying its West Cole
Unit in Webb County, Texas.  This $186,000 payment is reflected as a credit to
unproved property acquisition cost in the table above.

The following table sets forth a standardized measure of the estimated
discounted future net cash flows attributable to Basic's proved oil and gas
reserves.  Estimated future cash inflows were computed by applying year end
prices of oil and gas (with consideration of price changes only to the extent
provided by contractual arrangements) to the estimated future production of
proved oil and gas reserves at March 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994.  The future
production and development cost represents the estimated future expenditures to
be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, assuming
continuation of existing economic conditions.  Future income tax expense was
computed by applying statutory income tax rates to the difference between
pre-tax net cash flows relating to Basic's proved oil and gas reserves and the
tax basis of proved oil and gas properties and available operating loss and
excess statutory depletion carryovers, reduced by investment tax credits in
accordance with the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Discounting the annual net cash
flows at 10% illustrates the impact of timing on these future cash flows.

In the year ended March 31, 1996, Basic realized an increase from the prior year
in the standardized measure of estimated discounted net cash flows.  This
increase in the standardized measure was primarily the result of (1) the
reserves added following the successful recompletion of the State #12-16 into
the Bakken formation, (2) the purchase of numerous small interests in various
wells which Basic operates, and (3) higher oil prices.
