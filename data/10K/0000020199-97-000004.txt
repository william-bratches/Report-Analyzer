               Item 1:       DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

               Church Loans &  Investments  Trust ("the Trust") is a real estate
               investment  trust  organized under the laws of the State of Texas
               in March 1963.  Although the Trust has the authority to engage in
               the business of buying,  selling and leasing of real estate,  the
               Trust has heretofore restricted its business activities primarily
               to making loans to churches and other nonprofit organizations and
               assisted  living centers which are secured by a first mortgage on
               real estate owned by such borrowers.

               The  period  of  duration  of  the  Trust,  unless  dissolved  in
               accordance with law, or by the consent of the owners of shares of
               beneficial interest in the Trust, is perpetual.  The Trust may be
               dissolved by the affirmative  vote of not less than two-thirds of
               the owners of outstanding shares of the Trust.  Owners of Secured
               Savings Certificates, a debt instrument issued by the Trust, have
               no vote in  regard  to any  activities  of the  Trust,  including
               dissolution.

               The  control  and  management  of the Trust  properties,  and all
               powers  necessary  or  appropriate  to effect  any and all of the
               purposes for which the Trust is organized, is vested in the Board
               of Trust Managers.  All managers are members of a congregation of
               the Church of Christ.

               The number of shares of  beneficial  interest  in the Trust which
               the Trust is authorized to issue is unlimited.

               The Trust is qualified as a "real estate  investment trust" under
               Sections  856-858 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended
               (the "Internal  Revenue Code" or "Code").  It is the intention of
               the Trust to  continue  to  qualify as a real  estate  investment
               trust under the Code.

               The  Trust  maintains  an  office  located  at  5305  I-40  West,
               Amarillo, TX 79106 (telephone 806/358-3666).

               As  mentioned  above,  the  Trust  is  primarily  engaged  in the
               business of making mortgage loans to churches and other nonprofit
               organizations  and assisted  living  centers.  The Declaration of
               Trust  restricts the investments of the Trust to loans secured by
               a first  mortgage,  deed of  trust or other  lien  covering  real
               property  with the  amount of such loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of
               the value of the real  property  securing such loan as determined
               by a competent independent appraiser. Although the Trust has been
               primarily in the  business of making  long-term  mortgage  loans,
               during the past several years it has been more involved in making
               short-term   interim  or   construction   loans  to  finance  the
               construction of church

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
               buildings,  the purchase of real estate,  or the  refinancing  of
               existing  indebtedness.  Most,  if not all, of the interim  loans
               presently  being  made by the  Trust  are  associated  with  bond
               offerings of churches and other  nonprofit  organizations.  These
               interim loans are scheduled to be repaid from the proceeds of the
               bond offerings.

               The Trust is not limited to the location of the property securing
               any  loans  in which  it may  invest  and  seeks  to  spread  its
               investments in areas of the United States where favorable  yields
               prevail.

               As of March 31,  1997,  the Trust has 169  permanent  and interim
               mortgage loans and investments in church bonds having a principal
               balance of $35,448,707, with the average principal amount thereof
               being  $209,755.66.  The interest  rates on these loans vary from
               7.0% to 17% per annum with the weighted  average interest rate of
               mortgage  loans and church  bonds being 10.82% per annum at March
               31, 1997. The original terms of these loans vary from one year to
               thirty years, with the majority being for a term of twenty years.

               During the fiscal year of the Trust ending  March 31,  1997,  the
               net income of the Trust was $2,126,758, as compared to $2,359,130
               in fiscal 1996,  a decrease of 9.85%.  The decrease in net income
               of  the  Trust  was  due to  several  factors,  including  (a) an
               increase  in  non-performing  loans;  (b) a  decrease  in  income
               realized from loan purchase discounts;  and (c) a decrease in the
               average  annual  interest  rate on loans and church bonds held by
               the Trust.

               The net  income  of the  Trust  for each of the  quarters  during
               fiscal  1997  was  as  follows:  first  quarter-$471,624;  second
               quarter-$595,170;    third    quarter-$580,120;    and     fourth
               quarter-$479,844.

               The  operational  expense of the Trust  increased  from  $554,397
               during  fiscal 1996 to $561,527 in fiscal 1997.  The  operational
               expenses  of the  Trust  were  approximately  14.62% of its gross
               income for the year ended  March 31,  1997 as  compared to 13.18%
               for the year ended March 31, 1996. The operational expense of the
               Trust   included   general  and   administrative   expenses   and
               compensation to members of the Board of Trust Managers.

               During  fiscal  1997,   the  Trust   advanced  loan  proceeds  of
               $16,691,347  on 46  different  loans.  Most,  if not all, of such
               loans bear  interest at a variable  rate equal to 2% per annum in
               excess of the prime rate of interest published by the Wall Street
               Journal and known as the "Wall Street Journal Prime."

               During  fiscal  1997,  the Trust  employed a total of 4 full time
               employees  and  employed,  as needed,  one  additional  part-time
               employee.

                                      -5-

     Item 2:   DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY

               The Trust  maintains  as its only place of  business  its offices
               located at 5305 I-40 West, in Amarillo,  Texas.  Such building is
               owned by the Trust and is occupied solely by the Trust.  There is
               no debt owed by Trust in regard to its real property.

               The real properties of the Trust are not a significant portion of
               the  Trust's  assets,  representing  less than 1% of the  Trust's
               total assets.

               As  previously  mentioned,  the Trust's  primary  business is the
               making  of  mortgage  loans  to  churches  and  other   nonprofit
               organizations  and assisted  living  centers.  The Declaration of
               Trust  restricts the investments of the Trust to loans secured by
               a first  mortgage,  deed of trust,  or other lien  covering  real
               property  with the  amount of such loans not to exceed 66 2/3% of
               the  value  of  the  real  property   securing  such  loan.   The
               Declaration of Trust may not be amended  without the  affirmative
               vote of two-thirds  (2/3 rds) of the  Certificates  of Beneficial
               Interest  entitled to vote. The Board of Trust Managers'  general
               policy is to limit investment of Trust assets in any one mortgage
               loan to not more than $2,000,000. All such investment in mortgage
               loans is for the purpose of earning income for the Trust.

               There is no  established  public trading market for the shares of
               beneficial  interest of the Trust.  During fiscal 1997 a total of

               ranging  from $2.20 to $3.00 per share.  The last sale during the
               fiscal  year was at $2.25 per share.  During  fiscal  year 1996 a
               total of  81,805  shares  were  sold in the  secondary  market at
               prices ranging from $2.25 to $2.31 per share.

               in the Trust are declared twice annually,  for the 3 month period
               ending  March 31, and the 9 month period  ending  December 31. In
               fiscal 1996 the Trust paid a cash dividend of $.32 per share.  In
               fiscal  1997 the Trust  paid a total  cash  dividend  of $.32 per
               share.

     Item 6:   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION

               RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--1997 COMPARED TO 1996

               During the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997,  interest income and
               fees of the Trust decreased by $365,970 (8.70%) over the previous
               fiscal year. Such decrease was  attributable to several  factors,
               including (a) an increase in non-performing loans; (b) a decrease
               in  income  realized  from  loan  purchase  discounts;  and (c) a
               decrease in the average annual  interest rate on loans and church
               bonds held by the Trust.  The  increase in  non-performing  loans
               resulted in an increase  in the  interest  income that would have
               been recorded  under the original terms of  non-performing  loans
               and church bonds from  $310,000 for the year ended March 31, 1996
               to  $389,000  for the year ended March 31,  1997,  an increase of
               $79,000.  Income from the realization of loan discounts from loan
               purchases  also  decreased from $311,975 for the year ended March
               31,  1996 to  $166,457  for the year  ended  March  31,  1997,  a
               decrease of $145,518.  The average annual  interest rate on loans
               and church  bonds held by the Trust  decreased  from 11.21% as of
               March 31, 1996 to 10.82% as of March 31,  1997.  The  decrease in
               interest income caused by the decrease

                                      -7-
<PAGE>
               in the average  annual  interest  rate on loans and church  bonds
               held by the Trust was somewhat  offset by the net increase in the
               amount  of  total   performing   mortgage   loans   and   interim
               construction  loans  held by the  Trust.  Although,  there  was a
               decrease in the amount of performing  mortgage  loans held by the
               Trust from  $21,886,390 as of March 31, 1996 to $19,177,849 as of
               March 31,  1997,  there was an  increase  in  performing  interim
               construction  loans during the recent fiscal year from $7,877,489
               as of  March  31,  1996 to  $12,133,111  as of  March  31,  1997.
               Therefore,  the total performing mortgage loans, church bonds and
               performing interim construction loans held by the Trust increased
               from  $29,763,879 as of March 31, 1996 to $31,310,960 as of March
               31, 1997.

               In fiscal  1997,  the  average  aggregate  amount  of total  debt
               outstanding was $1,353,139 less than in fiscal 1996. Furthermore,
               interest  expense  decreased  by  $183,901.   Such  decrease  was
               primarily  due  to a  decrease  in the  debt  of  the  Trust  and
               secondarily  to a  decrease  in the  Trust's  cost of funds.  The
               approximate  weighted  average  annual  interest  rate  upon  the
               aggregate  outstanding  debt  decreased  from 7.72% during fiscal
               1996 to 7.12% during fiscal 1997.

               The net  income of the Trust  for 1997 was  $2,126,758  ($.30 per
               share),  a decrease of $232,372  (9.85%) from the previous fiscal
               year.  Such decrease was primarily  attributable to a decrease in
               net interest  income in fiscal 1997 as compared to fiscal 1996 as
               discussed  above and to an increase in the provision for possible
               credit losses.  The increase  provision was due to an increase in
               non-performing  assets  and the  general  risk in the  portfolio.
               Dividends  related  to 1997 were  $2,312,442  or $.33 per  share.
               Dividends  are based on  taxable  income  which  varies  from net
               income reported in the financial  statements because of temporary
               differences  (differences  between  the tax  basis of an asset or
               liability  and its reported  amount in the  financial  statements
               that will  result in  taxable  or  deductible  amounts  in future
               years).  Future dividends may be less than net income reported in
               the financial  statements because of variances in these temporary
               differences.

               During fiscal 1997,  the prime interest rate increased from 8.25%
               at March 31,  1996 to 8.50% per annum at March 31,  1997.  Should
               the prime interest rate decrease during fiscal 1998, the interest
               expense of the Trust will  generally  decrease and the net income
               of the Trust will in turn  generally  increase.  Should the prime
               interest rate increase  during fiscal 1998, the interest  expense
               of the Trust will  generally  increase  and the net income of the
               Trust will in turn generally decrease.

               Principal  payments  received on the interim and  permanent  loan
               portfolio and the church bonds held by the Trust  decreased  from
               $18,434,281 during fiscal 1996 to $14,921,586 during fiscal 1997,
               a decrease of 19.06%. This decrease was primarily attributable to

                                      -8-
<PAGE>
               the  increase in interim  loans held by the Trust as of March 31,
               1997 which  were not paid off  during  the fiscal  year and to an
               increase in the amount of non-performing  loans of the Trust from
               $2,769,345  as of March 31,  1996 to  $3,158,484  as of March 31,
               1997.  The  non-performing  loans of the Trust as compared to the
               entire loan  portfolio  of the Trust  increased  from 8.51% as of
               March 31, 1996 to 9.16% as of March 31, 1997.

               LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

               The  Trust  is  engaged  primarily  in  the  business  of  making
               permanent  and  interim  loans to churches  and other  non-profit
               organizations.  To fully utilize the Trusts  resources,  in 1995,
               the Trust began making certain  interim real estate  construction
               loans to entities  other than  churches.  At March 31, 1997,  the
               Trust had  $6,584,000 in  commitments  to one borrower to finance
               the construction of three assisted-living  centers. The assets of
               the Trust primarily  consist of its loan portfolio and its office
               building and facilities.  The operational expense of the Trust is
               comprised of the maintenance of its office building,  the payment
               of the  salaries of its  management  and  clerical  staff and the
               payment for legal and accounting  services.  Substantially all of
               the Trust assets are invested in the  permanent and interim loans
               made by the Trust. The only potential  liquidity  problems of the
               Trust are related to the timely and proper repayment by the Trust
               of the leveraged funds it has borrowed to make loans in excess of
               its  capital  and the  ability  to fund  loan  commitments  which
               totalled  $13,580,000 at March 31, 1997. All of the  indebtedness
               of the  Trust  is  generally  classified  as  short  term  having
               maturities ranging from "on demand" to maturities  repayable over
               various periods extending through 2000.

               The  annual  maturities  upon all debt  obligations  of the Trust
               outstanding  as of March 31, 1997 for the next three fiscal years
               are:  1998-$9,558,747;   1999--$2,716,725;  and  2000-$1,344,376.
               These debt obligations primarily consist of the Trust's bank line
               of  credit,   Master  Note   Agreements   and   Secured   Savings
               Certificates  ("Certificates")  which have been previously issued
               by the Trust.  Certificates outstanding as of March 31, 1997 that
               will mature  during the next three  years are:  1998--$3,512,871;
               1999-$2,716,725; and 2000-$1,344,376.

               At March 31, 1997 loans to the Trust under Master Note Agreements
               which are in effect demand notes total  $4,312,875.  In the past,
               the Trust has utilized its bank line of credit, principal paid to
               the Trust upon its outstanding  loan portfolio,  and the proceeds
               received  from  the  sale of  Certificates  in  order to meet its
               maturing obligations.

               At March 31,  1997,  the  balance  which could be borrowed by the
               Trust upon its bank line of credit was $8,266,999.  The principal
               payments scheduled to be received by the Trust upon its loan

                                      -9-
<PAGE>
               portfolio for the years ending March 31, 1998,  1999 and 2000 are
               $16,449,579,  $1,613,230, and $1,445,402,  respectively. Assuming
               all of these  scheduled  principal  payments are received,  these
               payments,  together with the balance available to Church Loans on
               its  bank  line of  credit,  would  allow  Church  Loans  to have
               sufficient  funds to meet its maturing  obligation  and fund loan
               commitments without the necessity for Church Loans having to sell
               any additional Certificates or borrow funds from other sources.

               During  fiscal 1997 and 1996 the Trust sold  Certificates  in the
               principal amounts of $2,648,579 and $4,595,999, respectively. Due
               to the cost of  registration  and of sales of such  Certificates,
               the cost of these  funds  are  normally  higher  than the cost of
               borrowing from bank sources or master notes. Therefore, the Trust
               is  presently  considering   discontinuing  the  registration  of
               Certificates  and seeking  additional bank financing.  If so, the
               Trust will have to cease the sales of Certificates as of July 16,
               1997. Based upon the success of the Trust to obtain borrowings in
               the past, the Trust is confident that, should it be necessary, it
               will be  able to sell  Certificates  or  obtain  additional  bank
               financing  in the future in  sufficient  amounts for the Trust to
               timely  meet  all  of  its   obligations.   To  the  extent  that
               Certificates  sold by the Trust have maturity  dates of one year,
               or less,  the  financial  condition  of the  Trust  would  not be
               substantially  improved since the proceeds  received by the Trust
               from the sale of Certificates will, of necessity,  be used to pay
               the  principal and interest  upon  Certificates  maturing in this
               period.

               Should all the  scheduled  principal  payments upon loans made by
               the Trust not be received, and should the Trust elect not to sell
               Certificates  or be unable  to sell  Certificates  with  maturity
               dates  and in  amounts  described  above or  should  the Trust be
               unable  to  borrow  against  its  line  of  credit,   and  should
               borrowings  from  other  sources  not be  available  it  would be
               necessary  for the Trust to sell a portion of its  mortgage  loan
               portfolio  in  order  for  it  to  meet  all  of  its   financial
               obligations. At March 31, 1997, the principal balance of the loan
               and  church  bond  portfolio  of the Trust was  $34,469,444.  The
               weighted  average  interest  rate on loans and  church  bonds was
               10.82%  per  annum.  In  view  of  the  normal  marketability  of
               conventional  loans,  the Trust  would  probably  be  required to
               discount  the great  majority of these loans in order for them to
               be attractive for purchase.  The principal  amount of these loans
               if discounted to yield a weighted  average  interest rate of 12%,
               14% and 16% would be $31,079,950,  $26,639,957,  and $23,309,963,
               respectively.  There is no assurance that the Trust would be able
               to sell all, or a portion of, its  portfolio  of loans,  in which
               event,  it would be necessary  for the Trust to secure a loan, or
               loans, from a lender in order for the Trust to meet its financial
               obligations.  There is no assurance  that the Trust would be able
               to secure a loan in such instance. The Trust has sold only

                                      -10-
<PAGE>
               one of the loans in its mortgage loan portfolio and therefore has
               limited experience in this area.

               Principal payments scheduled to be received by the Trust upon its
               permanent loan portfolio  during the years ending March 31, 1998,
               1999 and 2000, if not used to fund new loan commitments, would be
               used to reduce the outstanding  indebtedness of the Trust. Should
               the Trust use the payments of  principal  which shall be received
               upon its loan portfolio to reduce its  outstanding  indebtedness,
               the  interest  expense  of  the  Trust  will  decrease.  In  such
               instance,  whether  the  decrease  in the  interest  income  will
               exceed,  or be less than,  the decrease in the  interest  expense
               will  largely  be  dependent  upon  the  prime  rate of  interest
               prevailing  at such time due to the fact that the  interest to be
               earned by the Trust upon its mortgage loan portfolio is generally
               based  upon a  fixed  rate  of  interest  or a  variable  rate of
               interest  that  periodically  reprices,  while the interest to be
               paid by the Trust  upon its  outstanding  debts is  directly,  or
               indirectly,  tied to the prime rate of interest  charged by major
               domestic banks.

               As of March 31, 1997,  a  substantial  portion of the  promissory
               notes evidencing the loans made by the Trust have been pledged to
               secure its outstanding indebtedness. At March 31, 1997 promissory
               notes in the principal  amount of $9,087,494  had been pledged to
               secure  Certificates which had been previously sold by the Trust.
               The  required  collateral  for these  Certificates  (based on the
               ratio of 1.25 to 1 of notes pledged to the  principal  balance of
               the  Certificates  in  Series  A-N  and a  ratio  of 1.0 to 1 for
               Certificates  in Series O) was  $7,832,722,  leaving an excess of
               promissory  notes which have been  pledged by the Trust to secure
               said Certificates of $1,254,772.  Additionally,  promissory notes
               totalling $8,013,983 were pledged against the bank line of credit
               which had a total outstanding balance of $1,733,001. The required
               collateral for this bank loan was  $1,906,301,  leaving an excess
               of  promissory  notes which have been pledged to secure said bank
               notes  of  $6,107,682.  These  excess  promissory  notes  may  be
               reassigned  by the  Indenture  Trustee or bank to the Trust to be
               sold in order  for the Trust to meet its  financial  obligations.
               Should  it be  necessary  in  order  for the  Trust  to meet  its
               financial obligations, these excess notes amounting to $7,362,454
               and other additional  promissory notes in the approximate  amount
               of  $17,367,967  (for a total  amount  of  $24,730,421)  would be
               available  to  be  sold  by  the  Trust  to  meet  its  financial
               obligations.  Should the excess  promissory  notes be assigned by
               the  Indenture  Trustee  or  bank  to  the  Trust  as  heretofore
               described, all outstanding Certificates sold by the Trust and the
               bank line of credit would  continue to be secured by the required
               ratio  of  notes  pledged  to  the  principal  balance  of  these
               Certificates  and the bank line of credit.  There is no assurance
               that the Trust would be able to sell all, or any portion of these
               notes.

               Cash flows from operating  activities  consists  primarily of net
               income.  The primary components of net income are interest income
               and  expense.  Interest  income  should  continue  to be the main
               source of cash  provided by operating  activities;  however,  the
               availability  of this cash flow is dependent  upon the ability of
               the borrowers to repay loans.  Although  there was an increase in
               the amount of non-performing  loans as of March 31, 1997 compared
               to March 31, 1996,  management does not expect material increases
               in such  loans  in the  future.  Accordingly,  cash  provided  by
               operating  activities has been and is expected to be a relatively
               stable source of cash flow.

               Cash flows  from  investing  activities  results  primarily  from
               investment  in and  payments  received  on  mortgage  and interim
               construction loans and church bonds.

               Cash flows from financing activities relate primarily to the sale
               of and payments on  Certificates  and  borrowings and payments on
               notes payable and the line of credit.  Certificates  are sold and
               borrowings  are  made as funds  are  needed  to make  loans or as
               current  obligations  become  due.  Based upon the success of the
               Trust to sell Certificates and obtain borrowings in the past, the
               Trust is confident that it will be able to sell  Certificates and
               obtain borrowings in the future in sufficient amounts, along with
               payments to be received on loans, to timely meet its obligations.

               INFLATION

               At March 31, 1997,  the  weighted  average  interest  rate on the
               mortgage  loan and church bond  portfolio of the Trust was 10.82%
               per  annum  while the  weighted  average  interest  rate upon all
               borrowings of the Trust was 7.36% per annum.  Although a majority
               of the loans  constituting  the loan  portfolio of the Trust have
               been made at variable  rates of interest that  generally  reprice
               either daily or annually, a portion of the loans constituting the
               Trust's loan  portfolio have been made at fixed rates of interest
               and  therefore  are not subject to being  increased  or decreased
               during the term of the loan. All of the indebtedness of the Trust
               is  either  directly  or  indirectly  tied to the  prime  rate of
               interest  charged by major banking  institutions and therefore is
               subject to  fluctuation.  During periods of inflation,  the prime
               rate of interest charged by major banking  institutions,  as well
               as the interest rate or cost of borrowing  money from any lender,
               generally increases.  Consequently, during an inflationary period
               the  interest  expense  of the Trust  would  increase.  Since the
               interest  income of the Trust would not  increase as rapidly,  an
               increase in the interest  expense of the Trust would decrease the
               net  income  of  the  Trust.  However,   interest  income  should
               subsequently increase as variable rate loans reprice.  Should the
               amount  of the loans and the  amount of the  indebtedness  of the
               Trust remain  constant,  and should the weighted average interest
               rate upon the indebtedness  increase to approximately  28.20% per
               annum,  the interest income and the interest expense of the Trust
               would be substantially equal.

     Item 8:   CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON
               ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

               KPMG Peat Marwick LLP was  previously  the principal  accountants
               for the Trust. As of June 1, 1995, KPMG Peat Marwick LLP sold its
               Amarillo,  Texas office to Clifton Gunderson P.L.L.C.  Therefore,
               on June 14, 1995 the Trust dismissed KPMG Peat Marwick LLP as the
               Trust's independent auditors.  The decision to change accountants
               was approved by the Board of Trust Managers.

               The KPMG Peat Marwick LLP report on the financial  statements for
               the  1995 and 1994  fiscal  years  did not  contain  any  adverse
               opinion,   disclaimer  of  opinion,   nor  any  qualification  or
               modification  as  to  uncertainty,  audit  scope,  or  accounting
               principles.

               Furthermore,  there were no disagreements  with KPMG Peat Marwick
               LLP  on  any  matter  of  accounting   principles  or  practices,
               financial statement disclosure,  or auditing scope or procedures,
               which  disagreements if not resolved to their  satisfaction would
               have  caused  them to make  reference  in  connection  with their
               opinion to the subject  matter of the  disagreement  in regard to
               the audits of the fiscal years ended March 31, 1994 and March 31,
               1995.

               The Board of Trust Managers engaged Clifton  Gunderson  P.L.L.C.,
               independent  certified public  accountants,  on June 14, 1995, as
               the  auditors of the  financial  statements  of the Trust for the
               fiscal year ending March 31, 1996.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Trust Managers and Shareholders
Church Loans & Investments Trust
Amarillo, Texas

We have audited the  accompanying  balance  sheets of Church Loans & Investments
Trust (a real estate  investment  trust) as of March 31, 1997 and 1996,  and the
related statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the years
then ended.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the  financial  position of Church Loans &  Investments
Trust as of March 31, 1997 and 1996,  and the results of its  operations and its
cash  flows for the years  then  ended in  conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles.

                   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

                             MARCH 31, 1997 AND 1996

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Church Loans &  Investments  Trust  (Church  Loans) is a real estate  investment
trust that  invests  primarily  in mortgage  and interim  construction  loans to
churches across the United States,  particularly in the southern  portion of the
U.S.  During 1995,  Church Loans also began making  certain  interim real estate
construction  loans to entities other than churches.  Church Loans requires that
real estate  properties  be pledged  against  loans as  security  which could be
foreclosed  by Church  Loans  should the  borrower  default.  Repayment  of each
borrower's  obligations  is generally  expected to be repaid from  contributions
from church members, or in the case of interim  construction loans, by permanent
financing provided by others.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting  period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CURRENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

Church Loans has historically invested in long-term,  fixed-rate mortgage loans,
generally funded by relatively  short-term secured savings  certificates  (SSCs)
and debt obligations. The volatility of interest rates and increased competition
to attract  customers'  funds have caused Church Loans'  liability  structure to
become short-term and rate sensitive. Church Loans reflected an average interest
yield on its loan and church bond  portfolio,  an average  interest  rate on its
total  indebtedness and a net interest rate margin at March 31, 1997 and 1996 as
follows:

                                   LOAN AND CHURCH      TOTAL       NET INTEREST
                                   BOND PORTFOLIO    INDEBTEDNESS   RATE MARGIN
                                   --------------    ------------   -----------
March 31, 1997 ....................    10.82             7.36           3.46
March 31, 1996 ....................    11.21             7.10           4.11

Church  Loans  finances  maturities  of SSCs and debt  obligations  through  its
available lines of credit,  the issuance of SSCs and principal payments received
on its mortgage and interim construction loans.

CHURCH BONDS

Church bonds,  secured by first mortgage liens on church facilities,  are stated
at cost,  as there is no traded market for the bonds and  management  intends to
hold such securities until maturity.

                   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

                             MARCH 31, 1997 AND 1996

LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR POSSIBLE CREDIT LOSSES

Loans are  stated at the  amount of unpaid  principal,  reduced  by  unamortized
purchase discounts and the allowance for possible credit losses. Interest income
on loans and church bonds is recognized when earned.

Impaired loans are measured  based on the present value of expected  future cash
flows  discounted at the loan's  effective  interest rate or the market price or
the  fair  value of the  collateral  if the loan is  collateral  dependent.  The
accrual of interest is  discontinued on loans and church bonds more than 90 days
past due or when there is  sufficient  doubt as to the  collection  of interest.
When interest accrual is discontinued,  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed.
Cash  interest  payments  received are applied to principal  when  collection of
principal  is in doubt or are  recognized  as interest  income when  recovery of
principal is reasonably assured.

The allowance for possible credit losses is established  through a provision for
possible  credit losses  charged to expense.  Loans and church bonds are charged
against the allowance when management  believes that the  collectibility  of the
principal is unlikely. Recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited
to the allowance.  The charge to operations is based on management's  evaluation
of the loan and church bond  portfolio,  including  such factors as the security
collateralizing  the loans or church  bonds,  past  credit loss  experience  and
general  economic  conditions.  The allowance is subjective in nature and may be
adjusted in the near term because of changes in economic conditions.

Loan  origination fees are collected only on a few permanent loans and generally
recognized as income when received and the associated loan origination costs are
expensed when incurred.  The effect on the accompanying  financial statements is
not materially  different from generally  accepted  accounting  principles which
require that loan fees, net of origination costs, be deferred and amortized into
interest income over the life of the related loan.

Commitment fees received on interim  construction  loans are recognized over the
interim commitment period for loans that are not permanently  financed by Church
Loans  and over the life of the  mortgage  loan for loans  that are  permanently
financed by Church Loans.  Amounts are being amortized  using the  straight-line
method.  This method was not  materially  different from the method of deferring
commitment fees until the commitment is exercised and  recognizing  such fees as
an adjustment to yield by the interest  method over the related  loans' lives as
prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles for the years ended March
31, 1997 and 1996.

Purchase discounts on loans are amortized based on the interest method.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property  and  equipment  are  stated at cost,  less  accumulated  depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on the  straight-line  method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 18 years.

UNAMORTIZED DEBT EXPENSE

Commissions paid to brokers in connection with the sale of SSCs are deferred and
amortized  over the terms of the related  certificates  on the interest  method.
Costs  incurred in  connection  with the  registration  of SSCs are deferred and
amortized on the straight-line  method over the period the related  certificates
are sold,  but no longer than two years from the date the  registration  becomes
effective.

INCOME TAXES

Income taxes are accounted for under  Statement No. 109,  ACCOUNTING  FOR INCOME
TAXES.  Under the asset and  liability  method of  Statement  109,  deferred tax
assets  and  liabilities   are  recognized  for  the  future  tax   consequences
attributable to differences  between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing  assets and liabilities  and their  respective tax bases.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled.  Under Statement 109, the effect on deferred tax assets
and  liabilities  of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date.

CASH FLOWS

For  purposes  of  reporting  cash  flows,  cash  and cash  equivalents  include
cash-on-hand  and investment in a money market mutual fund and  certificates  of
deposit with maturities of less than 90 days at the time of acquisition.

This information is an integral part of the accompanying financial statements.

                             MARCH 31, 1997 AND 1996

NOTE 1 - LOANS AND CHURCH BONDS

Mortgage loans  receivable  consist of  conventional  loans of  $20,600,313  and
$23,637,917 and church bonds due principally  from  congregations of Churches of
Christ  of  $520,894  and  $828,661  at March 31,  1997 and 1996,  respectively.
Interim  construction  loans of $14,327,500 and $9,213,466 at March 31, 1997 and
1996, respectively,  consist primarily of loans to churches for the construction
of church  facilities.  Mortgage  loans,  church bonds and interim  construction
loans are generally secured by first liens on real estate comprised primarily of
church buildings,  ministers'  residences and other real estate. The amount of a
loan is  generally  limited  to 66-2/3% of the  appraised  value of the  related
property.   Certain  loans  are   guaranteed   by  individual   members  of  the
congregations  or  other   individuals  or   congregations,   depending  on  the
circumstances.  The individual  endorsements  are usually for a specific  amount
with the sum of all such  guarantees  being an amount at least equal to the loan
amount.

Church  Loans'  portfolio  included  mortgage  loans,  church  bonds and interim
construction loans with interest rates ranging from 7% to 17% at March 31, 1997.
The weighted average annual interest rates of Church Loans' loan and church bond
portfolio were 10.82% and 11.21% at March 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

The following schedule is a summary of the combined  mortgage,  church bonds and
interim construction loan portfolios by size of loan at March 31, 1997 and 1996:

income which would have been recorded under the original terms of  nonperforming
loans and church bonds amounted to  approximately  $389,000 and $310,000 for the
years ended  March 31, 1997 and 1996,  respectively.  Interest  income  actually
recognized was not significant.

Included in maturities  for the year ended March 31, 1997 are other demand notes
payable of $4,312,875.

All debt obligations,  except for other demand notes payable, are secured by the
pledge of specific mortgage notes receivable.

Maturities of SSCs and debt obligations are financed through principal  payments
received on mortgage loans,  advances on other demand notes payable and advances
on the  $10,000,000  line of credit which is expected to be renewed on an annual
basis.

Descriptions of the various categories of debt obligations follow:

SECURED SAVINGS CERTIFICATES

SSCs are issued in amounts of $1,000 or more and have single maturity dates from
30  days  to 10  years  from  date  of  issue.  With  respect  to an  individual
certificate, interest rate and frequency of payment of interest (either monthly,
quarterly,  semiannually,  annually  or at  maturity)  are  fixed at the time of
issuance of the certificate.

The certificates are secured under the terms of certain indentures that require,
among other things,  the pledge of mortgage notes  receivable  with total unpaid
principal  amounts not less than 100% or 125% of the aggregate  principal amount
of certain respective SSC registrations outstanding.  Due to the fluctuations in
the amount of sales of certificates as well as in the repayment of notes pledged
to secure the certificates,  Church Loans has on occasion failed to maintain the
required ratios of pledged notes to outstanding  certificates for a short period
of time until the deficiency could be corrected.  The indenture trustee has been
aware of these  temporary  technical  defaults  of Church  Loans and has  waived
declaration  of a default under the respective  Indenture.  As of March 31, 1997
and 1996, Church Loans was in compliance with the requirement.

NOTE 2 - DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CONTINUED)

SECURED SAVINGS CERTIFICATES (Continued)


Church Loans has an agreement with Great Nation  Investment  Corporation  (Great
Nation)  whereby Great Nation will use its best efforts to sell SSCs  registered
by Church Loans. The agreement  provides that Church Loans will pay Great Nation
a commission on the basis of an annualized  rate equal to  three-fourths  of one
percent per annum of the face amount of each certificate sold by Great Nation.

LINE OF CREDIT PAYABLE TO BANK

The line of credit payable to bank consists of borrowings under a loan agreement
effective  through  September 1, 1997,  that provides for a $10,000,000  line of
credit with certain commitment fees. The loan agreement requires Church Loans to
pledge  mortgage  loans  receivable  having  unpaid  principal  balances with an
aggregate  present  value,  discounted at 1% over the prime rate (8.50% at March
31, 1997), of not less than 110% of all indebtedness owed to the bank.  Interest
accrued at the prime rate less one quarter of one percent from September 1, 1996
to March 31,  1997 and at the prime rate from April 1, 1995 to August 31,  1996.
Interest is payable semiannually.

Additionally,  the line of credit  requires  that Church Loans' net worth not be
less than  $18,000,000 and its total  indebtedness  shall not exceed 150% of its
net worth. At March 31, 1997, Church Loans' total indebtedness was approximately
$18,200,000 less than the maximum amount permitted under the agreement.

DEMAND NOTES PAYABLE

The demand notes  payable bear  interest at 1% less than the prime rate (payable
monthly) and are unsecured (see note 6).

NOTE 3 - INCOME TAX PROVISION

Church Loans has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a real estate  investment
trust under the Code, Church Loans must, among other things, distribute at least
95% of its taxable income to its shareholders through dividends. Church Loans is
required to pay  dividends  of at least 85% of its calendar  year  undistributed
income by February 1 or be subject to a special  federal excise tax of 4% on the
undistributed amount.

Deferred  taxes were not  significant  to Church Loans' 1997 and 1996  financial
statements.

Total  income tax  expense  for the years  ended March 31, 1997 and 1996 is less
than the amount computed by applying the applicable statutory federal income tax
rate (35%) to income before provision for income taxes as follows:

                                                         1997        1996

dilutive securities outstanding during any of the periods presented.

NOTE 5 - DIVIDENDS

All  dividends  paid by  Church  Loans are  taxable  as  ordinary  income to the
recipient.  A schedule of  dividends  paid during the years ended March 31, 1997

In April  1997,  a  dividend  of  $700,740  ($.10 per share)  was  declared  for
stockholders of record on March 31, 1997.


NOTE 6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Other demand notes  payable at March 31, 1997 and 1996 included  notes  totaling
$1,648,660 and $1,482,250, respectively, which represent borrowings from related
parties.  The  notes  bear  interest  at 1% less  than  the  prime  rate and are
unsecured. Interest expense incurred on related party other demand notes payable
was not significant for 1997 or 1996.

Secured  savings  certificates  at March 31, 1997 and 1996 include  certificates
totaling  $315,692 and $485,692,  respectively,  which represent  liabilities to
related parties.  Interest  expense incurred on savings  certificates of related
parties was not significant for 1997 or 1996.

NOTE 7 -      DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
              INSTRUMENTS

The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial  instruments,  the results of applying  such methods and
assumptions to the financial  instruments and limitations inherent in fair value
estimates:

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The assets are considered  short-term  instruments for which the carrying amount
is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                             MARCH 31, 1997 AND 1996

LOANS AND CHURCH BONDS

Fair  values  are  estimated  for  portfolios  of loans with  similar  financial
characteristics.  Loans are  segregated  by type,  such as mortgage  and interim
construction  loans and church bonds.  Each loan  category is further  segmented
into  fixed  and  adjustable  rate  interest  terms.  For  variable-rate  loans,
primarily  interim  construction  loans,  that  reprice  frequently  and with no
significant  change in credit risk,  fair values are based on carrying  amounts.
The fair value of fixed-rate  mortgage loans and bonds is generally estimated by
discounting  the future cash flows  through  the  estimated  maturity  using the
current  rates at which  similar  loans would be made to borrowers  with similar
credit  ratings.  The estimate of maturity is based on Church Loans'  historical
experience with repayments for each loan classification,  modified, as required,
by an estimate of the effect of current  economic  and lending  conditions.  The
carrying  value of loans,  net of the allowance for loan losses was  $33,614,231
and  $31,804,559 and the fair value of loans was  approximately  $34,759,000 and
$33,164,000 at March 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

NOTES PAYABLE AND LINE OF CREDIT

The fair value of notes payable and the line of credit are equal to the carrying
value as such liabilities are deemed to be short-term borrowings.

SECURED SAVINGS CERTIFICATES

The fair value of secured  savings  certificates  is  estimated  using the rates
currently  offered for financial  instruments  of similar  characteristics.  The
carrying value of secured savings certificates was $7,573,972 and $7,545,375 and
the fair value of secured savings certificates was approximately  $7,585,000 and
$7,549,000 at March 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

Generally,  Church Loans enters into  commitments to extend credit at adjustable
interest terms.  Accordingly,  the commitment amount is a reasonable estimate of
fair value.

LIMITATIONS

Fair value  estimates  are made at a specific  point in time,  based on relevant
market  information  and  information  about  the  financial  instrument.  These
estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering
for sale at one time Church  Loans'  entire  holdings of a particular  financial
instrument.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of Church Loans'
financial  instruments,  fair value  estimates are based on judgments  regarding
future   expected   loss   experience,   current   economic   conditions,   risk
characteristics  of various  financial  instruments,  and other  factors.  These
estimates  are  subjective  in nature and involve  uncertainties  and matters of
significant  judgment  and,  therefore,  cannot be  determined  with  precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
