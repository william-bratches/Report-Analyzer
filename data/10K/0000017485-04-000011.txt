<STRONG>ITEM 1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</STRONG>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Cardiff Communications, Inc.,  ("the Company") was organized in December 1906 in the State of Utah under the
name Cardiff Mining &amp; Milling Company.  During the 60's the Company changed its name to Cardiff Industries, Inc. and sold
its mining operations.  During the next decade the Company focused its operations on the television and radio industry.
Consequently in 1980, the Company's name was changed to Cardiff Communications, Inc.. The Company changed it's
domicile to the state of Nevada in 2000.  The Company has had no operations in the last 10 years, but intends to pursue
business opportunities in the communications industry. </P>

<P>					 </P>

<P>	The board of directors feel that the Company does not meet the criteria of a development stage company (as defined
in SFAS 7 " <EM>Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises</EM>") primarily because it is not currently producing
or marketing a product or service. However, the Company is currently seeking a business opportunity to merge with or
acquire, but to date has not located any such business opportunities.  </P>

<P>			 </P>

<P>	In seeking a business opportunity to merge with or acquire, management is reviewing various business plans.
Management has not limited their review of plans or exploration of acquisitions to any particular industry or service sector,
but does have a primary interest in communications and broadcasting opportunities. Though there appears to be a large
number of companies seeking to merge with an existing public company, the management has not yet identified a business
to complete such a transaction with and the Company has not entered into any binding agreements for an acquisition or
merger. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in finding any business opportunity to merge with or
acquire.  </P>

<P> <STRONG>	     RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS</STRONG> </P>

<P> 							 </P>

<P> 	The Company is not currently trading in any public markets and has not been able to obtain any reliable trading
history for the period reported.   As of June 1, 2004, the Company had approximately 1,165     shareholders of record. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P> 	The Company has not declared any cash dividends on its Common Stock in the last thirty years and its Board of
Directors has no present intention of declaring any dividends.  For the foreseeable future, the Company intends to retain all
earnings, if any, for use in the development and expansion of its business. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P> 	During April 2003, 170,000 of the Company's common stock was issued to the president of the company for services

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P> <STRONG>Financial Condition</STRONG> </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P> 	The Company had no revenue during the year ended September 30, 2003.  The total accumulated deficit was
$110,313, as compared $43,998 at September 30, 2002. The Company has no operating capital for future operations. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P> <STRONG>Liquidity and Capital Resources</STRONG> </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P> 	The Company has  minimal liquid assets and is currently in the process of looking for business opportunities to merge
with or acquire.  At minimum, the Company will need to raise additional capital through private funding to meet the financial
needs of being a reporting company.  Historically, the Company has been successful in raising operational capital.  There is
no guarantee that the Company will be successful in obtaining necessary funding to develop any business opportunities. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P> <STRONG>Results of Operations</STRONG> </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P> 	The Company reported a net loss of $66,316 for the year ended September 30, 2003, compared to a net loss of
$22,537 for the previous year.  The Company anticipates very little or no overhead from future operations except for those
expenses related to being a reporting company, until a successor business can be acquired or merged. </P>

<P> 	 </P>

<P> 	During September 2003, approximately $6,400 of accounts payable were settled in exchange for convertible notes
and are reflected in that portion of the Company's financial statements. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Cardiff Communications, Inc., as of September
30, 2003 and 2002, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows
for the years then ended.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express and opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, in the United
States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Cardiff Communications, Inc., at September 30, 2003 and 2002, and the results
of its operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles, in the United States of America.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will
continue as a going concern.  As discussed in Note 5, the Company's recurring operating losses and
lack of working capital raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Management's plans in regard to those matters are also described in Note 5.  The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>NOTE 1 - Corporate History</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Company was organized on December 8, 1906 in the State of Utah under the name of "Cardiff
Industries."  Subsequently, the name was changed to "Cardiff Communications, Inc.".   During 2001,
the Company changed its domicile to the State of Nevada.  The Company's management anticipates
merging with or acquiring an as yet unidentified on-going business in the future.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>NOTE 2 - Significant Accounting Policies</STRONG>  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>A.	The Company uses the accrual method of accounting.</P>

<P>B.	Revenues and directly related expenses are recognized in the period when the goods are
shipped to the customer. </P>

<P>C.	The Company considers all short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible,
within three months, to known amounts as cash equivalents.  The Company currently has no
cash equivalents. </P>

<P>D.	Basic Earnings Per Shares are computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period.  Diluted Earnings Per Share shall be computed by including contingently issuable
shares with the weighted average shares outstanding during the period.  When inclusion of
the contingently issuable shares would have an antidilutive effect upon earnings per share
no diluted earnings per share shall be presented.</P>

<P>E.	Estimates:   The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>NOTE 3 - Income Taxes</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Company adopted Statement of Financial Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income taxes" in
the fiscal year ended September 30, 1999.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" requires an
asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income tax purposes.  This
statement recognizes (a) the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (b)
deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized
in the financial statements or tax returns.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of accounting
transactions for tax and financial reporting purposes.  There were no temporary differences for the
current year accordingly, no deferred tax liabilities have been recognized.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>NOTE 3 - Income Taxes (continued)</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Company has cumulative net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $110,000 at
September 30, 2003.  No effect has been shown in the financial statements for the net operating loss
carryforwards as the likelihood of future tax benefit from such net operating loss carryforwards is
highly improbable.  Accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net operating loss carryforwards,
estimated based upon current tax rates at September 30, 2003 have been offset by valuation reserves
of the same amount.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>NOTE 4 - Notes Payable</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In order to meet it's operating needs, the Company has issued several convertible promissory notes
totaling $139,285.  The notes bear interest between the rates of 5% and 10% per annum, which are
secured by the Company's common stock and are due on demand.  The notes are convertible to the
Company's common shares, provided, however, such conversion may be made in amounts that do
not result in the creation of new affiliate status or in the issuance of control to one person, or a group
of persons who are affiliates of each other.  At September 30, 2003, the total accrued interest totaled
$22,298.</P>

<P> The Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles
applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of
liabilities in the normal course of business.  Currently, the Company does not have significant cash
or other material assets, nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its
operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern.  The Company does not currently
possess a financial institution source of financing and the Company cannot be certain that it's
existing sources of cash will be adequate to meet its liquidity requirements.  However, the Company
is undertaking the following approach to meet its liquidity requirements. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P> 	(a)	Seek additional equity funding through private placements to raise sufficient funds to
continue operations and fund its ongoing development, merger and acquisition activities.  </P>

<P> 	(b)	The Company will seek to continue converting certain outstanding loans and payables
into common stock in order to reduce future cash obligations; </P>

<P> 	(c)	Management is identifying prospective acquisition targets with sufficient cash flow to
fund operations, as well as potentially generating operating cash flow that may sustain
corporate administrative expenses; <BR>

from the exercise of the outstanding options were not included in the computation of diluted loss per
